5848556,2008/5/22,Debt collection,False statements or representation,"First : I never received a final bill from either XXXX or KIA Motors Finance regarding the charges on the account. I was never properly notified of this debt, and my credit was severely impacted as a result. The following are the issues that I have been facing with the XXXX company : I previously was able to pay my monthly payments online on the Pay XXXX XXXX website. On XX/XX/XXXX, I logged in to the portal and noticed that I could not pay my balance. The section of the portal that states the balance was blank. I thought that this was odd because I did not receive any letters, emails, or calls regarding the account. So, on XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX to discuss the account and whether it had been inactivated. The person that I spoke with stated that my account was still active and that it had been grandfathered in to their new system. That persons supervisor assisted me with getting access to their new system. The new system ( on a completely different website named XXXX Now ) stated that I owed over {$10000.00} on my account, which was over double the actual amount that I owe. Unfortunately, the call ended before I could discuss this with the supervisor. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX again to dispute the amount that was stated on the account, but I was unable to speak to anyone. I also noticed during that call that I was unable to pay using the automated system because it stated that my account had not been authenticated yet. I left a message for XXXX to return my call. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I missed a call from XXXX because the call only rang once before ending. No voicemail was left. This is odd because XXXX typically leaves a voicemail and they are aware that they can leave a message. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX of the representatives named XXXX XXXX. We spoke for a couple of seconds before the call disconnected. I called her back immediately, but I was informed that she went to lunch. The man that I spoke with offered to help, so I informed him of the situation. He proceeds to tell me that I have a new account number. He also informs me that theres a third web portal where Im supposed to be paying. I inquire as to why I was not notified about this, and he stated that he wasnt sure. I log on to the portal with the new account number, and notice that the total amount that I owe has once again increased to over {$12000.00}. I bring this to the mans attention as this is now XXXX times what I owe, but he is unsure of the reason for the discrepancy. I notify the man that I will try to pay my balance using the new number and the automated phone system because I do not feel comfortable disclosing my bank account information to such a shady company. Even with the new account number, I receive the same message that states that my account can not be authenticated. I speak with a representative who states that she will have XXXX give me a call back once she returns from lunch, but I never receive a call from her. I go online to try to pay on the new portal, and I notice that there are XXXX different accounts all under my name and that XXXX of the accounts are for a XXXX XXXX Account. The third account is for XXXX XXXX. All three of these accounts are incorrect because my car was financed through KIA Motors Finance. At this point, I do not feel comfortable paying into any of the accounts because I can not guarantee that anything is legitimate, especially considering I never received a final bill from KIA Motors Finance. 

After that, I tried calling to speak with XXXX XXXX multiple times, but was never able to get in contact with her until XX/XX/XXXX. She transferred me to her manager, XXXX XXXX. I point out all of the discrepancies that I have been having with my account, but nothing is resolved. Instead, she continues to insist that I pay over the phone or mail in my payment. I also discussed with her the fact that the system doesnt allow me to make a payment in the amount that I typically pay.

Now I have spent over 5 hours trying to have them remove the charges from my statement so that I can pay them the correct amount. They will not do this but also tell me that if I don't pay them, they will hit me with late charges as well as interest.

I have had mostly poor reps who do not want to help because it will take too long and it will XXXX up their call center XXXX metrics. I did get one good rep that spent the time with me to try to do the calculations to determine what I owe but even that rep could not do it because Citi does not give them excel to help work on these issues and they do not have systems that can handle situations like this. They also keep telling me that I am liable for these charges until the point that they determine they are frauds ( and insinuating that this is probably not fraud ). I have had credit cards for 35 years and have had fraud before but they always immediately remove them from my account during the investigation stage so that I can know what to pay them.

I was further advised that my account was secure. 

This constitutes a major error on BoA 's behalf, as the XX/XX/XXXX email was in fact the legitimate result of the XXXX XXXX, someone other than myself, fraudulently accessing my BoA account and adding a fraudulent transfer account ending in XXXX, routing XXXX to my profile, to which they would fraudulently transfer {$3000.00} via a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX later that same day, XX/XX/XXXX.

5842859,2008/5/22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Problem with a credit reporting company's investigation into an existing problem,"My name is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX I am filing this complaint because I have exhausted all of my possible options to rectify a situation in which my credit card company "" Discover card "" refuses to rectify even after they admitted to the error being on there behalf. U believe under the "" CARES ACT '' they should have removed late payments and went back to reporting it current because of cover .I have been trying to get this matter resolved for about a year now. I have even worked closely with one of the XXXX credit reporting company to resolve the issue but after months of trying to resolve the issue through them, I was told I could only fix the problem through discover card, they could only make a note of the error. The error that I am referring to is Discover card had reported my account late on payment 3 times resulting in my credit score to drop XXXX pts. I have been with Discover for XXXX year and I have been in good standing throughout the duration and I continue to do so even today when they have not fixed the error. I am currently XXXX living In XXXX paying XXXX a month to stay here because my once excellent credit score is to low to get approved for a home. The error accord when back in oct/nov of 2020 this is during the pandemic. I reached out to them to see what pandemic relief programs were available because most of my other credit card had programs. My mother was going through a really bad divorce at the time so I moved in to help her but she was forced to sell the home in the divorce so I was trying to get a jump on all my finances so that's why I reached out. I then consulted with a young lady in which she came up with a program in which my monthly minimum payment would increase from XXXX to XXXX a month and it would keep me current in terms of my payments. Which I agreed to because I she said by doing so I wouldn't be reported late. So I moved into a hotel with my mother for 3 months while we looked for a home. finally found one and was denied do to my credit score. Thats when I realized Discover was reporting my account late even though the program the young lady put me in was taking the amount out of my account monthly through automatic payment. So I didn't realize the dip in my score because to my knowledge the money was coming out of my account. Once I found this out I immediately contacted Discover to rectify the situation. This is prime time in the pandemic most ppl were working from home. So it was difficult to actually get a manger on the phone or find anyone who could resolve this issue. I finally got a manager after weeks of sitting on hold being transferred day by day to get someone who either transferred to someone who couldn't help or just simply hung up. I finally got a manager in which understood what happen then credited my account XXXX dollars do to the error on behalf of the employee who essentially put me in the wrong program which wasn't making my account which was the reason for me calling in the first place. I let several people know about he situation I was in, pleaded with several ppl who simply didn't care and didn't want to fix the reporting side of the issue which was do to the fact there employee was misinformed and then misinformed me. I was told I had to go through credit bureau ( XXXX ) etc to remove the late payments, eventhough the money was automatically coming out of my account every month and is still doing so till this day. I then filed disputes with equfiax which took more months to resolve which finally they said we can make a note of it but Discover is the actual one who has to remove the wrongful late payments. I Still call and try to get them to fix this error, employees understand that its an error but no one has any intent on helping me fix this. I am literally homeless and I have never had a late payment with Discover. I don't know what to do at this point. I just understand that it is not fair practice for them to do this to people who haven't done anything wrong. I have been the standard of customer as I said I have never had a late payment in 7 years. So to whoever is reading this I am pleading someone to help me bring this to resolution. I have attached the 3 months in which I was being reported late and the money was automatically coming out of my account. I also never received in calls from them to bring me current. I also have file showing Discover credited my account XXXX dollars because they admitted the error was on there behalf.Under the cares at that shows My account should of never been reported late.",Yes,"Category 2: Physical characteristics or personal descriptors.

I immediately called Bank Of America by phone and the agent transferred me to speak with someone from XXXX. 
The person from XXXX said that there was a 50/50 chance that I would get my money back, but I probably wouldn't. And even if I did it would take about 4 months. 
I then used XXXX site to file a complaint with the FBI. And I then contacted XXXX, but as of now, I have not received a reply. 
Today, XX/XX/XXXX, I went to speak to Bank Of America in person and as soon as I said "" XXXX '' the person shook their head no and said there was no protection for me and that they don't even recommend using XXXX at all. To me, that was odd considering Bank Of America promotes the use of XXXX. 

So now I'm stuck. I used XXXX to send money to a person they said was verified, using the XXXX service which my bank encourages me to use, and now nobody wants to help me. It's as if the scammers have all the protection and I have none.",No,,No,

It was charged by XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, CA I was not there nor did they have Authorization. It took a while of yelling at them for them to put it back, but they did. They tried to blame it on computer system issues. 
After that, WF took the money out again last month, blaming it on length of charges taking to settle. No such thing happens like this. I also noticed that they had my debit card number, it's Defenitely fraud. 
I've argued with the bank repeatedly, it shows just how crooked this bank is. 
They also filed a claim but that's also fraud because they did it as if I filed it ... ... they lied about giving me the claim number, seems pretty screwy. I've contacted this place also but they won't return the money.

5869028,2008/11/22,Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"After paying mortgage insurance premiums for 6 months on my mortgage loan, I contacted United Wholesale Mortgage on XX/XX/21 and asked them to remove the mortgage insurance. The purchase price for my home was $ XXXX. The home, at the time, was worth $ XXXX $ XXXX. I provided my mortgage statement, an XXXX, and showed that I could make the payments for 6 months. UWM refused to remove the mortgage insurance on XX/XX/21. They said that I needed to prove that I had done enough work to the house to merit what was already plain as day : that the LTV  should not be based on the purchase price. I should mention that the XXXX that I provided was obtained directly from their website. OR that I needed to wait to "" season '' my home 2 years before they would consider *charging me for an appraisal* in order to get my PMI removed OR I could pay {$36000.00} off on my loan to get the fraudulent LTV adjusted XXXX 
The point of mortgage insurance, I thought, was to protect the lender from losing money on the home if I failed to make payments. I proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that in the event that my mortgage foreclosed, UWM would *profit*. I wrote back to them on XX/XX/21 stating again that the equity in the home more than covered any risk involved. UWM wrote me back on XX/XX/21 stating that "" We must adhere to investor guidelines as it relates to the removal of PMI. '' UWM also completely botched up my escrow account, first telling me I had an overage and sending me a check for the excess, then raising my mortgage by almost {$500.00} per month after they realized that they do not know how to do math or properly account for property taxes. California property taxes are always reassessed when a person purchases a home. The property tax rate is based on a percentage of the assessed value ( which, by the way, is assessed at over $ XXXX so, again, the PMI is unnecessary ). Yet UWM completely failed to account for this ( obvious ) fact and set up my escrow account with the previous owners ' property tax bill.",No,,No,
