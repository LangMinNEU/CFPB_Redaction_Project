These errors have caused me financial harm, emotional stress, and have restricted my ability to access fair credit opportunities. I have tried to resolve these matters directly with the credit reporting agencies and the furnishers of the information, but they have failed to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA, 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA, 15 U.S.C. 1692 ). 
Below are the specific disputed accounts : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Wrong Address Issue : This address is not mine. Law : FCRA 607 ( b ) requires agencies to follow reasonable procedures to ensure maximum accuracy. Story : This false address creates a misleading impression that I lived at a place I never did. Because of this, I have been questioned during applications about my residence history, which caused me embarrassment and delays. I have had to explain repeatedly that this is not my residence, making me feel like I am being accused of dishonesty. Such stress and humiliation are unacceptable, especially when I am applying for credit or rental housing. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Wrong Address Issue : Not my residence. Law : FCRA 611 requires proper reinvestigation of disputes. Story : Reporting a false address makes it look like I have unstable housing history.

It feels deeply unfair to be portrayed as financially reckless based on inaccurate reporting. 
XXXX XXXX XXXX High Balance : {$830.00} Date Opened : XX/XX/XXXX Charge-Off Issue : Reported as a charge-off without validation. Law : FDCPA 809 requires debt validation. Story : This false charge-off has destroyed my ability to qualify for fair credit. It portrays me as someone who abandoned financial obligations, when in reality no proof exists.

15623914,08/30/25,Credit card,Fees or interest,"Consumer Complaint : Synchrony Credit Card Deferred Interest Trap In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Synchrony credit card to finance my XXXX  XXXX after being offered a promotion of no interest for 24 months. At the time, I was told that : No interest would apply during the promotional period. 

I would receive a heads-up notice before the promotion expired. 

Setting up automatic payments would keep my account in good standing. 

Based on that, I set up autopay ( as recommended ) and made consistent payments for nearly two years, believing I was protected.

However, when I reviewed my account in XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered the following : On XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony posted {$1100.00} in accrued interest. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the day my promotion expired, they added {$2400.00} in deferred interest charges. 

After XX/XX/XXXX, additional monthly interest charges continued to appear on my statements, even though I was still making payments. 

Here is the record of my balances and statements : XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} ( deferred interest applied ) XX/XX/XXXX {$1100.00} ( interest charge posted ) Despite continuous payments, my balance did not go down it increased every month due to back interest and new interest charges. Synchrony claims statements were sent, but no warning was ever provided about the deferred interest expiration, even though I was promised advance notice. 

To make matters worse, the promotion expired specifically on the XXXX of the month, which feels like an intentional setup to catch consumers off guard between billing cycles. Combined with their recommendation to use autopay ( set by default to minimum payments ), this seems designed to ensure most customers fall into the trap. 

My request : I am asking Synchrony to refund the deferred interest charges ( {$1100.00} + {$2400.00} + the ongoing accrued monthly interest shown above ). I entered this financing in good faith and was misled by their advertising and failure to provide a clear notice.

Pursuant to DISCOVER BANK 's online advertisement, DISCOVER BANK encourages people to use their online system to apply for a credit card and states that its the "" quickest '' way to get approved. I did not get a card for approval nor did I get anything in the mail from DISCOVER BANK stating that my information was used or attempted to be used in order to open an account. Thus, DISCOVER BANK has failed its duty, under California consumer laws and regulations by properly requesting necessary information and documentation to approve a card under my name. Moreover, DISCOVER BANK violated federal laws when it approved a card under my name to someone else and is exposed to selling and/or buying my information under different affiliates, exposing them to a lawsuit under California 's due diligence acts and approval under misrepresented information and/or documentations. With that said, I am requesting for DISCOVER BANK to immediately withdraw the charge off from my credit as I have previously stated that I did not own to account nor made any used of it.",No,,No,

Experian has failed to provide either, proving this is an unauthorized and illegal access to my private credit information. 

I filed a formal dispute with full identification, yet Experian has knowingly ignored federal law by keeping these inquiries on file and refusing to produce a signed application, proof of permissible purpose, or furnisher certification as required under 1681i ( a ) ( 5 ) ( B ). They have not provided the legally mandated Method of Verification under 1681g ( a ) ( 2 ), even after being formally requested. This is blatant noncompliance with 1681b, 1681e ( b ), 1681i ( a ), and Metro 2 reporting standards, all of which require accuracy, documentation, and proper categorization.

This delay and inaccuracy not only destroy confidence in Experians reporting procedures but also directly damage my credit score and financial standing. 

Experian is fully aware that I am a verified victim of the XXXX  Data Breach and XXXX XXXX XXXX compromise. Any inquiry after these breaches must be held to heightened verification standards.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I was provided a Transaction Action Link by Blockchain stating that the transfer of the XXXX was sent and completed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with XXXX  and provided the information in the Transaction Action Link and they were able to resolve the issue ( XXXX  does not currently support XXXX via XXXX XXXX ). A refund was processed by XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX back to its original wallet and I provided the updated to Blockchain. On XX/XX/XXXX I was advised from Blockchain that the funds had not yet been returned and that another transfer could not occur until the funds had been returned. I continuously followed up with both XXXX and Blockchain checking on the status of the refund. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received confirmation from XXXX that the refund had been returned to the original wallet and was provided a Transaction Action Link. Blockchain was then notified on XX/XX/XXXX that the refund had been completed and I provided the information from the Transaction Action Link provided from XXXX  and advised that I did not have any other XXXX wallets to transfer the funds to and would like to have these remaining funds converted to USD to finalize the close out of my Blockchain account.

Pursuant to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ), 15 U.S.C. 1692g, I formally dispute this debt and request full validation of your claim. Under federal law, you are required to cease all collection activities until you provide adequate verification of the alleged debt.

Request for Verification : Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), you must provide : 1. Proof of your legal standing to collect this debt, including a valid assignment or chain of title demonstrating ownership of the debt from the original creditor to your agency.

2. A full itemization of the alleged debt, including principal, interest, fees, and all charges.

3. Copies of any contracts or agreements bearing my signature that establish my liability for this alleged debt.

4. Proof that the original creditor did not receive any insurance payment, government relief, or tax write-off that nullifies the debt under case precedents such as Perry v. Stewart Title Co. , 756 F.2d 1197 ( 5th Cir. 1985 ).

Potential Fraud Concerns : I also challenge the legitimacy of this debt on the grounds that the original creditor may have already received compensation for any alleged loss. If the creditor was insured against default or received compensation through other means ( such as an insurance policy, a tax write-off or government bailout ), then the alleged obligation may have been extinguished. Courts have held that a party can not seek double recovery for the same loss, as seen in FDIC v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 20 F.3d 1070 ( 10th Cir. 1994 ).

Additionally, if the debt has been securitized and sold as part of an asset-backed security, the original creditor may no longer have a valid claim, as illustrated in Carpenter v. Longan , 83 U.S. 271 ( 1872 ), which supports the principle that the note and security instrument can not be separated.

Creditor Accepted payment. Account already discharged : The alleged debt was already paid and discharged by the alleged creditor. Please cease all collection activity.

15350098,08/18/25,Debt collection,Attempts to collect debt not owed,"I received a letter dated XX/XX/year>, from Nelson & Kennard XXXX attempting to collect an alleged XXXX  XXXX XXXX charged-off account. The letter is on attorney letterhead listing numerous lawyers, but in the fine print they disclose : Nelson & Kennard, LLP is a debt collector. This communication raises several serious violations : 1. False or misleading representation ( 1692e FDCPA ) : The letter strongly implies attorney involvement and review, but no licensed attorney appears to have reviewed my account individually. Using attorney letterhead without actual legal involvement is deceptive and intimidating.

Listing numerous state bar licenses while functioning purely as a collection agency is a misrepresentation intended to pressure the consumer.

2. Failure to provide validation of debt ( 1692g FDCPA ) : The letter does not provide any proof of ownership, assignment, or contract. It references a XXXX  XXXX XXXX account that was already charged-off. 
No supporting documents were included with their initial communication, which is a violation.

3. Collecting without proof of standing : If Nelson & Kennard owns the account, they must disclose assignment/chain of title. If they do not, they are attempting to collect without proof they are the rightful creditor.

This is a direct violation of both the FDCPA and Californias Rosenthal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.

4. Threat of credit reporting without validation : Their letter pressures me to pay or respond, but does not acknowledge that they can not legally report this to consumer reporting agencies without validation.

5. California Rosenthal Act violations : This firm is operating in California and is therefore subject to additional protections for consumers. Their letter engages in misleading intimidation tactics that are prohibited.",No,,No,

I provided official documentation from XXXX XXXX confirming that my account was paid on time and fully satisfied, and no debt was owed.

Given the fact that CITIBANK has the right to investigate and obtain all necessary information prior to approving any credits, CITIBANK has failed to uphold that duty and has caused my information to be used in a scam. Furthermore, CITIBANK must have gotten signatures along with other identifying information prior to opening an account under my name and failed to do so under the law and regulation of California along with the Federal laws that CITIBANK must comply with prior to approving any credit card/lines to anyone.

And just my account was working perfectly fine these past couple days with no issues what so ever until I was at work needed to grab lunch and I work remotely in different locations because Im a commercial driver. My wife had sent me money for lunch and when I went to order and pay for my lunch my card kept on getting declined and I had tried to send the funds back to my wife and have her help me order my lunch it wouldnt even let me send the funds back.

But now I needed to access the funds to pump gas for my new job that I just started work for. So I had miss work today the XXXX of XXXX because couldnt access the funds for gas. While I was on hold again today for over 2 hours got a hold of someone from the fraud department, he then told me that the back office had decided to close my account. I then had ask him why he stated he couldnt say and have to wait for a letter, then I ask can I at least get access to my funds so that I can pump gas to get to work on Monday. He stated I have to wait for a check to be mailed to me. I then ask to speak to a supervisor he got his manger on the line she stated her name was XXXX and she the manger of the fraud department. I then requested to at least let me get access to my funds for gas or at least let me send the funds back to my wife account so that I can still use it for gas. The rep then proceeded to say that she cant because the account is in the closing process and proceeded to giggle and laugh at what was going on taking it as a joke. I had ask her what kind of guarantee that she can provide me that I will receive the check after account being closed when I still havent received that verification letter that was mailed out to me through the mail to this date. she ignored the question and proceeded on saying that I will have to just wait for a check after the accounts close in 30 to 60 days after the accounts close then I should receive a check which then I stated to her so youre basically telling me that Im not gon na be able to access the funds or received a check until about almost 4 months.

I could hear her colleagues in the background, saying something to her, and as I try to explain the situation of reasons why I needed to access the funds and stuff she still kept on, proceeded to giggle laugh taking everything as a joke.

This account contains several inaccuracies and missing information that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 
Issues with the Account Reporting : 1. No Original Creditor Identified The report lists Credit Collection Services as both the collection agency and original creditor, which is contradictory and incomplete. 
2. Missing Account Details The account does not provide the account type, account number, or the original service provider the debt allegedly came from. 
3. No Contact or Payment Information There is no address, phone number, or payment channel listed for this collection, preventing me from validating or resolving the debt.

4. Open vs. Collection Status Conflict The account is marked both as Open and Placed for Collection. This is misleading and unfairly impacts my credit.

5. Unverified Balance The {$210.00} balance is not itemized ( no breakdown of principal, interest, or fees ), making it unverifiable. 
Because the account is missing critical information and is reported inaccurately, I am requesting that it be deleted from all of my credit reports unless Credit Collection Services can fully validate it with proper documentation.
