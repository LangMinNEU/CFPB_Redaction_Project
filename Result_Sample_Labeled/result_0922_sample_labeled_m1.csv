5957965,2009/7/22,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"My mortgage company is Freedom Mortgage. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for covid 19 Mortgage forbearance due to reduce of income, process went through correctly, I was able to pause my mortgage for 6 months, On XX/XX/XXXX, I use my mortgage website to submit a request for an additional 6 Month of extension, and bring the expiration date to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called the mortgage company on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and request information in way to exit forbearance, I was told by the representative that my Portal claim is already approved, and just want for the total due amount to reset back to normal, then I can start making normal month payment as before. 
After 2 months of patiently waited, I called the mortgage company and asked about it, then I was told that my account was delinquent with no action token after forbearance. After spoke with at least 3 different people, no one can tell me what happened, and just told me that I need to submit supporting documents in order to get review, I refused and asked why do I need to provide those documents while I already have a partial claim, they did not have an answer for me, and told me that they will note it and do some research on it. 
I then finally ran out of patient as no one could tall me exactly what happened, I requested to speak to the supervisor directly. When I did, the supervisor informed me that my partial claim was cancelled due to the extension of my forbearance. Base on what the supervisor told me, and I have to come up with my conclusion, as the supervisor is trying not to tell me directly that they messed up. 
Here is my own conclusion, Someone ( not me ) exited my forbearance for me without my authorization, and make the expiration date on XXXX instead of the end of XXXX like it should be. I realized that on XXXX and called the mortgage company and asked why, I was informed at the time that the exit of forbearance was mistakenly submitted ( I did not request it ), but the rep told me that they can fix it for me, but instead of making the expiration date back to XX/XX/XXXX like it should be, they gave me another 6-month extension with the new expiration date as XXXX XXXX. 
I guess the partial claim was submitted for only from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I never got to see the partial claim, when it got submitted, approved, or cancelled, thats why I can only guess. None of these transactions were show in my account portal or getting any mails regarding that. 

Now the mortgage company told me that there is no other option for me to take other than mortgage modification which will significantly increase my interest rate, and making these much harder for me to keep the property. I asked if I can still take the VA partial claim option since I was always staying on top of my account, but due to the fact that I was getting wrong information and time ran out while I was expecting that my account is approved for all the process and just need to be applied to my account. I asked them to submit the VA partial claim as they deadline is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Mortgage company refused and claim that the deadline has already past, I request them to confirm with the VA Mortgage department, they refused and insist than they were correct with the deadline and requirement. 

Moving forward, I can not change whats already happened, but I would like to get an option that I can afford and get back on track with my payment. While assuming all the information on https : //www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/partial_claim.asp are correct, my mortgage company just refuse to help me. 
Therefore, I am hoping to have some help from a 3rd party entity.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

Unbeknownst to me, the auto pay became effective immediately on XX/XX/XXXX and Synchrony Bank withdrew a 3rd payment in the amount of {$12000.00} from my business checking account. Therefore, on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid total of {$25000.00} on a {$13000.00} balance. On XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to make a purchase of approximately {$1000.00} and it was declined.

To the best of my recollection, I contacted them approximately six times to try to accomplish these : 1 ) Attempted on the phone and was told that I needed to visit a branch to close the checking account. Created a request to close the credit card account and was told it would be processed or I would be contacted 2 ) Visited a branch, where it was confirmed that my initial concerns about Regions bank and its credit card partner were confirmed by the bank manager and I received my funds. 
3 ) Attempted to close credit card with Regions Greenline customer service, as I received another bill 4 ) Attempted to close credit card with Regions Greenline, as I received another bill. Recurring charges accumulated on the card. As I had closed the account, I expected these types of bills to come due from the merchants ( much as if I had canceled a credit card if it was lost or stolen and the number became inactive ), not for Regions to continue operating an account I had asked them to close several times and had been assured would be processed on these phone calls. 
5 and 6 ) Contacted by Regions customer service twice to attempt to collect fees and charges that had accrued due to their incompetence in closing my account.

On XX/XX/2022 around XXXXXXXX XXXX while I was driving back home, I noticed my Bank of America app on my phone was notifying, so I stopped to check and the app was telling me that there has been several unsuccessful attempts to log in to my account, so for me to log in I have to change my password and username. After doing that I found out that there was one unauthorized transfer from my son 's XXXX XXXX 's account to my own checking account with the amount of XXXX USD and to make it worse I noticed four unauthorized XXXX transfers from my checking account with the amount of XXXX USD. I immediately called the bank and they told me to change the password and the username immediately and I gave them all the information about this incident and the person who was talking to me told me that in ten to eleven business days I'll be credited with temporary amount for this occurred fraud, till this investigation is concluded. After two to three weeks I received two emails and two letters from Bank of America stating that the case is closed and that they found out that there was nothing suspicious, well in this case I strongly disagree with the Bank 's investigation. Because of the following points : 1.It is suspicious that I'll do four XXXX transfers from my account to the same person whom I do not know and when I asked the Bank about his phone number or who he is or his contact, the Bank gave me no answer so far. 
2.Usually when there is a XXXX transfer I receive a text message and an e-mail, checking my text message and my e-mail I did not find anything, and when I asked the Bank about why I didn't receive and e-mail or a text, they said that the e-mails and the text were deleted instantly. I strongly feel suspicious about this activity, transferring to the same person at the same time frame, and deleting all e-mails and texts, the Bank however should have sent all corresponding e-mails, that they've received or sent, instead of telling me that it was instantly deleted. This is highly evident that I've been a target to fraud, and the bank is not cooperating or launching a real investigation with all the their tools and means of investigation.

I had one direct deposit that was going to be deposited into their Bank at XXXX in the morning it was from social security. I don't have physical checks so I usually write a cashier 's check or a money order to pay my rent. Well the card was declined. The interesting thing about this new card was that my picture was on the face of the card for the first time ever. So I stepped out of line to call the bank and discovered that there was a block put on my account furthermore I was directed to the fraud department who explained to me that there was a transaction that took place without my consent and that's why the card is being blocked. Didn't call me beforehand they didn't they left me feeling as if the transaction had already been taken care of. In any case I would have to call back the next day and talk with somebody at the bank or should I say debit card company. I was on the phone with them for hours on the XXXX and I felt like I was being trifled with the woman I talked to could barely speak English to me I didn't understand most of the things that she was saying she had somebody standing behind her giving her direction. I thought that this issue would have warranted something more than a training session. When I got out of it was if there was three transactions that occurred with three different companies an approximately $ XXXX {$500.00} have been taken out of my social security check to pay for this and I would not get that money back unless I agree to the investigation which is ongoing I guess.

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to use this debit card to withdraw {$1000.00} from the ATM at the Bank of America ATM on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX CA. The ATM denied the withdrawal saying I had reached my maximum withdrawal for the day, however, I never went to the bank that day. I called the Bank of America customer service number on the back of my card and they said there were ten {$1000.00} withdrawals, one a day, for the past 10 days. As soon as I realized my money was being stolen on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America Prepaid Claims to cancel that debit card and send me a new card. I have not used the new card and I cut up the old card. 

I filed a fraud claim with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. I included the following transactions. 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX 24 minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal 30 seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal Then Bank of America rejected my claim because they said I made the withdrawal at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. After looking into it, I realized the agent and myself made a mistake by including two transactions that I had actually made. I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX and I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked Bank of America to remove the two withdrawals I made on those dates and to send in a reconsideration of the claim with those two withdrawal transactions removed. Bank of America said the removal of the two transactions were approved and removed from the claim, however, Bank of America still kept denying the claim. 

The following transactions are definitely fraud and I have been trying to dispute them for since XX/XX/XXXX to get the {$8000.00} from me that was stolen : XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal XXXX seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX  $ XXXX withdrawal There were eight total {$1000.00} withdrawals that I did not do which are fraud. 

On XXXX XXXX I filed a police report with the City of XXXX. The police report number is : XXXX and the officer is XXXX # XXXX. Currently, Detective XXXX of the XXXX Police Department is working on my case to press criminal charges against the person who committed fraud against me. When I spoke to Detective XXXX yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX, She informed me that she spoke with Bank of America and they told her the footage is now deleted as it expires after 120 days. However, I believe Bank of America is lying that they no longer have the footage because they mailed me a still capture image of myself at the ATM from XX/XX/XXXX and they mailed that to me on XX/XX/XXXX, which is way past 120 days. Now Bank of America is lying to the police. 

I feel like Bank of America has been pushing me around in a circle and now the footage that proves my innocence to get my money back is "" erased '', according to Bank of America. 

I request the {$8000.00} stolen from me is returned. I have filed numerous complaints to Bank of America against agents who misled me during the claim process and against agents who said they did something that they did not actually do. I.E. removing the two transactions that were me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX a supervisor who said their team working on my claim will review all the footage. That never happened. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the claim was denied again because XXXX, a supervisor in Kansas said they were only looking at the two videos of me, and they had not looked at any additional footage from the other dates that I was disputing since the first video showed me at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. She said she requested for the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX to be removed. She also said the withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX was removed from the claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, a Bank of America agent from Georgia. She said she did a withdrawal to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction and sent in a request to escalate it. This was contradictory to what XXXX told me, because she said the XX/XX/XXXX transaction was already removed, but this other agent said it was not. XXXX said she also did not see a letter generated to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction, so she submitted a request to remove that transaction from the claim. She also filed three complaints against agents who did not properly file the removal of transactions and she claims that she escalated those complaints. My claim was still getting denied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX in Alabama. She submitted a reconsideration request of my claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX in Nevada. I told her that in the mail, I received still captures of two transactions that I did. One on XX/XX/XXXX ( which was not included in the claim ) and one from XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why Bank of America won't send me the footage/still captures of the other eight ATM withdrawals that I know were not me. She said since Bank of America identified me in the transaction from XX/XX/XXXX, they didn't look at anymore footage, they just denied the whole claim. She also confirmed that the two transactions on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were finally removed and excluded from the claim. However, If this was truly the case, I don't know why the claim would still get denied when the other 8 transactions will not show me because I was never at the bank in the wee hours of the morning when those 8 transactions took place. XXXX also submitted a request to have the images of the other 8 transactions mailed to me. I was waiting over two weeks for these images but I never received anything in the mail. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to supervisor XXXX in Texas. He submitted another reconsideration request and he recommended I write another letter to Bank of America explaining the situation. I submitted another detailed letter to them via fax and still have heard nothing back. According to Agent XXXX, there are still attempted transactions being made on the old card even up to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the OCC and State Banking Regulator of CA. They recommended I file a complaint here. 

Bank of America, to my knowledge, never reviewed all the tapes of the transactions that were in this claim. 

Overall, the patterns of these fraudulent transactions do not align with my behaviors using the debit card and I know the footage of the eight withdrawals I am contesting will show the person making those withdrawals, I solemnly swear is not me, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have also been a loyal Bank of America customer for personal checking accounts since XXXX and my current business accounts are also with Bank of America since XXXX.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

6029182,09/28/22,Checking or savings account,Managing an account,"On XX/XX/2022, 14 unintended purchases were made from a mobile game downloaded from the XXXX XXXX XXXX and installed on one of our phones. These 14 purchases amounted to a total of {$780.00}, which we would never, intentionally, spend on a mobile game. Our USAA Debit card is setup on the XXXX XXXX XXXX so we can pay for several subscriptions and any other services. Unfortunately, we did not configure the security features in XXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for authorization, typically a fingerprint or password, before any manual purchase is made, since the owner of the phone is an adult. The family member who unintendingly made the purchases, fell asleep with the mobile game running, and part of her arm was touching the screen, which touched the coin package purchase button within the game, which is readily accessible, several times, and since there were now purchase authorization prompts, they went right through. I only noticed once I started receiving notifications on my phone about all the transaction taking place in succession. When I went to ask my family member about it, I noticed she was asleep and what was happening with her phone and mobile game. 

Immediately on that same day, we reached out to XXXX to try and have the transactions cancelled and refunded. We submitted the information they asked for on their XXXX XXXX refunds website while we chatted with a XXXX representative online. I also sent an email to the developer of the mobile game ( XXXX XXXX ), and they told us they can't process refunds and that we would have to do it through XXXX. The same day, XX/XX/2022, we called USAA and explained how these unintentional purchases happened, and they opened a dispute case. A day later, USAA refunded all the 14 purchases, which amounted to {$780.00}. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/2022, we noticed a charge from USAA that was not expected by us. I saw that this charge was a dispute credit reversal, which was for one of the unintentional purchases made back on XX/XX/2022. I called USAA 's customer support number and asked about the unannounced {$99.00} charge they made. When I asked more details about the charge and dispute, I was told that they found no errors in the transactions mentioned in the dispute and therefor, the amount they had refunded to us was going to be removed from my account within a week, which is XX/XX/2022. We asked for the dispute to be reviewed and that we did not agree with the final decision. I also explained what happened again and made sure they added the notes to the dispute in case it was not clear. 

No matter how much I tried and explained what happened, they said that they will still remove {$780.00} from my account. It didn't matter that the final decision is being reviewed, they will still take the money out of our account. I asked if there was anybody in USAA, a manager, director, anybody I could talk to, but I was told there wasn't anybody and that the person reviewing the dispute doesn't take direct calls. I was told a decision on the review will be communicated to us between 5-10 days. 

Interestingly, right after talking to USAA, we talked to a XXXX representative today, XX/XX/2022, and explained what had transpired with USAA. XXXX told us that they see all the 14 transactions as cancelled and that USAA shouldn't have processed any charges to our account. The XXXX representative created a case and set it as high priority so they can investigate and hopefully have an update before XX/XX/2022, which is when USAA is planning to take the money out of our account.",Yes,"Physical characteristics or personal descriptors.

6019831,09/27/22,Checking or savings account,Closing an account,"On XX/XX/2022 Chime closed my account for violating terms and conditions after a review. I was not given a specific reason why even after replying and requesting more information as to how decision was made. All they did was refer me to the user agreement which does nothing to indicate why my account was closed. It is just too vague to help me at all. I can not call them, as the auto message refers me to the email. I can not login to use chat, as my login credentials are no longer valid. 
So, after several years without a problem, now my money is gone and my future deposits are going to be returned. Any help would be appreciated here. 
Chime also did nothing to help me with multiple disputes I had with a single merchant that never sent my orders. I had over 20 orders that I never received over course of 12-14 months and Chime customer service said that I could open a dispute for each transaction I never got from the merchant. So, back in XXXX of XXXX, after spending hours on phone and collecting all the documents proving that I didnt get any of the orders, they almost immediately denied the claims and any appeal and then sent me a letter accusing me of falsely opening disputes to get temporary credit. This was a real slap in the face. I was absolutely floored. What am I supposed to do when I dont get the stuff I paid for? Chime doesnt care and accuses me of fraud. My first few years I promoted Chime, but these last few months have shown me that they are not to be trusted. Thank you for your time.

5960844,2009/8/22,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Other transaction problem,"In 2021 I started an account with BlockFi, who provided interest bearing accounts on cryptocurrencies you deposit with them similar to savings accounts. They provide crypto wallet addresses specifically for the account holder to send the deposits to, and those wallets are maintained by a third party custodian, I believe either XXXX or XXXX are who they use for custodial services. 

Back in XXXX of XXXX, I deposited just short of {$10000.00} worth of the stablecoin XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) over a couple days to my deposit address they provided me for XXXX. At the time however, the deposit page they provided did not specifically say to only deposit the XXXX XXXX version of XXXX  ( XXXX ) to the address given to me. Since it did not specify that, I sent the XXXX XXXX XXXX  version of XXXX  ( XXXX ) which was made to be compatible with XXXX  XXXX wallet addresses. 

My deposits made it to my provided deposit wallet address successfully. I can see the transactions on the XXXX just fine when looking up the wallet address. My nearly {$10000.00} worth of XXXX is still sitting in that address untouched and safe, but since it wasn't sent in XXXX, they refuse to credit it to me and claim that it is lost money that they hold no liability for and can do nothing to recover it. 

That however is not true, and they simply just don't want to help recover it, and say they can't because the wallets belong to their third party custodian who provided them with the addresses they gave to me. Now when I try to contact the custodians about it, they won't even talk to me because I don't actually have an account with them, BlockFi does, yet BlockFi refuses to contact them on my behalf to remedy the situation. 

Fixing this can be done in a matter of a few minutes if they wanted to be cooperative and it can be done in 2 different ways ... the first way would be for BlockFi to ask their custodian maintaining my deposit wallet address, to provide me with the recovery passphrase key, so that I could import that wallet address into a wallet app on my phone like XXXX, so that I can have access to the contents of it and just send that XXXX  back to my wallet I had sent it from. 

The other simple way to fix it would be for the custodian to simply switch the network on the wallet from their app from the XXXX  network to the XXXX network, which can be done in less than minute, so that they can see the XXXX  that is being held by that address which isnt visible while on the XXXX network, and then just send that XXXX  back to the same address which it came from. Recently I even sent some XXXX to that wallet address, which would be needed to pay for the transaction fee to send that XXXX  back to me, just to make it a quick and hassle free process for them to take care of. 

I should point out that there have been multiple other people who have had the same exact problem here with BlockFi that I am having, sending XXXX XXXX  instead of XXXX XXXX and BlockFi was not willing to help them either and claim they hold no blame and did nothing wrong. However if that were true, then they wouldn't have had to later update the deposit address page to start specifying XXXX tokens only, which you can see in the photos I've attached. They changed it because after this happened to multiple people they realized they partially negligent by not being clear on the original page, and they wouldn't have needed to change it if they did no wrong. 

BlockFi pays a third party to provide and maintain these wallet addresses for them, to provide to us.. If part of their agreement dictates they can't be given the recovery keys by the custodian for the wallets to provide me with or can't have the custodian directly provide me with the keys to my deposit wallet address so that I could have access to recover my digital assets instantly, they can at least ask the custodian to simply open the wallet on the XXXX XXXX really quick, so they can see the XXXX in there, and just send it back to the same address it came from, using the XXXX I recently added to more than cover the transaction fee. It isn't some complex and impossible task like they claim.. but they insist on not helping and so for over a year, a large sum of valuable digital assets of mine have been sitting there, not collecting interest, and being held hostage from me which someone would eventually get to just pocket if I were to die or something.",No,,No,
