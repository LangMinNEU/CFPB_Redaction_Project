Prior complaints were improperly closed as duplicates, despite addressing legally distinct issues. 

Goldman Sachs continues to furnish a charged-off account to the credit bureaus without providing legally required documentation to verify the accuracy, ownership, or validity of the alleged debt. 

Their only response has been to mail a packet containing generic transaction history which does not constitute legal validation under the FCRA or XXXX XXXX reporting guidelines.

To date, Goldman Sachs has failed to provide : A signed credit agreement or original application A complete charge-off ledger A XXXX or tax-related discharge documentation Proof of assignment, legal ownership, or chain of title No legally sufficient evidence has been produced to justify the continued furnishing of this tradeline. Transaction history is not proof of a valid, collectible, or legally reportable debt. 

This complaint is not about the validity of individual charges it is about the unlawful furnishing of incomplete and unverified data by Goldman Sachs in violation of FCRA 623. 

I am formally objecting to the continued reporting of this item and requesting a full reinvestigation. If no proper verification is provided, I will escalate this matter to the OCC, state regulators, and legal counsel for further action.",No,,No,

This included a formal request for certified ledger transactions, general ledger entries, loss deficit reports, red and black entries, and certified financial statements that could demonstrate that a legitimate financial loss or damage had been sustained by the alleged creditor.

Under UCC 9-210, as the secured party, Absolute Resolutions has a fiduciary obligation to respond to my formal request. As the debtor, I exercised my legal right to request an accounting of the obligation they claim exists. To date, they have failed to comply within the required 14-day statutory period, and no such certified audit or financial proof has been provided. 

This failure to respond constitutes a failure to meet the legal burden of proof for enforcing any claim of debt. Without certified accounting, the only legally recognizable balance is a credit balance in the amount of {$10000.00}, which under 15 U.S. Code 1666d must be returned as a refund. Any further collection activity on an unverified or fictitious debt becomes legally questionable.

Moreover, if no financial loss has occurredand if no verified chain of title, general ledger, or certified audit from a licensed accountant can be providedthe continued attempt to collect this alleged debt may constitute : Mail Fraud ( 18 U.S.C. 1341 ) : Using the U.S. Postal Service to pursue a fictitious debt.

Wire Fraud ( 18 U.S.C. 1343 ) : Communicating by electronic means ( calls, emails, etc. ) to enforce a non-existent obligation.

Violation of Disclosure Obligations ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : Misrepresenting the nature of the account balance and failing to disclose material facts.

Unfair and Deceptive Practices ( 15 U.S.C. 45 ) under the Federal Trade Commission Act : Misrepresenting a credit balance as a delinquent debt and refusing refund obligations. 

Violation of XXXX ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) : Refusal or inability to produce auditable financial statements violates basic financial reporting standards. 

I believe this behavior demonstrates a systemic pattern of unfair, deceptive, and potentially fraudulent business conduct, and I am requesting a full investigation.

Summary of Included Legal Grounds : UCC 9-210 : Secured party must comply with certified accounting requests from a debtor.

15 USC 1666d : Credit balances must be refunded.

The main claim number at issue is XXXX for a total disputed amount of {$24000.00}. 

Summary of Events I experienced identity theft resulting in multiple fraudulent ACH payments to XXXX XXXX from my Bank of America account. 

I immediately reported the fraud to Bank of America and submitted both : FTC Identity Theft Report Police Report Bank of America processed my dispute but split it into multiple claims. 

They credited and approved XXXX portion of the claim ( related to the same fraudulent XXXX XXXX transactions ), but denied the rest, even though all transactions are part of the same identity theft incident and are linked to the same case. 

My Concern Bank of Americas approach is inconsistent and unfair : If they acknowledged and reimbursed XXXX  transaction as fraudulent, all related transactions from the same merchant and same fraud event should be treated the same way. 

Their internal disorganization and decision to split my case into multiple claims should not penalize me, the victim. 

By denying the remaining transactions, they are effectively holding me responsible for fraud that I did not authorize, despite my timely reporting and submission of all required documents. 

What I Am Requesting That the CFPB instruct Bank of America to reopen claim # XXXX and treat all related transactions under XXXX unified case. 

That Bank of America either : Provide verifiable, signed proof that I personally authorized these transactions, or Immediately credit the funds back to my account under the protections of Regulation E, which requires reimbursement for unauthorized electronic fund transfers when reported in a timely manner. 

Supporting Evidence FTC Identity Theft Report ( submitted to Bank of America ) Police Report ( submitted to Bank of America ) Bank of America correspondence showing partial reimbursement was issued for a related transaction but others were denied This situation is creating significant financial hardship for me, and I believe it represents a failure by Bank of America to correctly process a linked set of fraudulent transactions. I respectfully request CFPB intervention to ensure that I am made whole for the total disputed amount.

Further, based on XXXX  own publicly filed financial documents including their XXXX, XXXX, Form XXXX, and trust filings with the SEC the account in question appears to have been sold and transferred into a legally isolated, bankruptcy-remote trust. TMCC clearly states in its filings that once receivables are transferred to securitized trusts, they are no longer TMCCs assets and are removed from their balance sheet. This means TMCC is no longer the owner or creditor of the account, and their continued furnishing of data to the credit bureaus constitutes misrepresentation under FCRA and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). They are falsely representing ownership of a debt they no longer hold, while also acting as a debt collector without proper disclosure a violation of FDCPA 807 and 809. 

Additionally, this reporting appears to violate XXXX XXXX compliance standards, particularly in the use of incorrect ownership codes, failure to flag the account as transferred or sold, and duplication of account status.

Why This Is a Regulatory Concern : Truth in Lending Act ( Regulation Z ) : Promotional terms must be accurately disclosed at the time of application. 
The XXXX SkyMiles offer was a material term I relied upon in making my application. 

FTC Act ( Section 5 Deceptive Practices ) : This is a textbook bait-and-switch. 
Amex advertised XXXX miles, induced me to apply, then tried to downgrade me to XXXX miles and stall resolution until the offer became irrelevant for my needs. 

Unfair Business Practices : Delaying resolution for 612 weeks ensures that customers with time-sensitive travel needs can not use the miles they were promised. 

This creates financial harm and undermines consumer trust. I will move most of my business to XXXX. They have better welcome offers and actually honor them. They have the back of the consumer. Visa cards might be the best way to go. 


Harm Caused : Loss of Time : Over six weeks wasted in repetitive chats, with no progress beyond we are investigating. 

Loss of Value : I can not receive the points before my XXXX honeymoon, undermining the reason I applied.
