Step 1:
	Code > 1_Load_Data_latest.ipynb

	To load and preprocess the raw data directly downloaded from CFPB database.

	Output: N/A (Simply raw data with fewer columns)



Step 2:
	Code > 2_PII_Detection_latest.ipynb

	To run processed data through Gemini API and record results.

	Output: See folder Result_All_Raw folder



Step 3:
	Code > 3_Resample_Results_latest.ipynb

	To get 100 samples out of each result file and label them as labeled data. Labeling are done manually.

Step 4:
	Put 40 labeled examples provided by Prof.Staddon, 400 labeled samples from results, and 20 made up "yes" data from "no"s together.

	Output: See folder Test_460



Step 5:
	Code > 4_Calculation.ipynb

	To get accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. Then use precision to calculate estimated correct number of positive cases in results.

	Output: See code file
