My credit reports with Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion show late payments for XX/XX/2024 through XX/XX/2024. 

These late payments are not accurate, not verified, and therefore not compliant with the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ).

Under FCRA 623 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), furnishers of information must provide accurate and complete reporting.

Under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( 1 ) ( A ), I have the right to a reasonable reinvestigation. I demand documented proof from the furnisher.

To date, no original source documentation has been provided to verify these alleged late payments. 

If XXXX XXXX can not produce proper verification, these late payments must be deleted from all credit reports as unverified.

16204232,09/26/25,Checking or savings account,Managing an account,"Dear CFPB, I am writing to formally request your assistance in reopening and reviewing my dispute with Bank of America regarding fraudulent transactions that occurred on my Bank of America checking account ending in XXXX. 

The main claim number at issue is XXXX for a total disputed amount of {$24000.00}. 

Summary of Events I experienced identity theft resulting in multiple fraudulent ACH payments to XXXX XXXX from my Bank of America account. 

I immediately reported the fraud to Bank of America and submitted both : FTC Identity Theft Report Police Report Bank of America processed my dispute but split it into multiple claims. 

They credited and approved XXXX portion of the claim ( related to the same fraudulent XXXX XXXX transactions ), but denied the rest, even though all transactions are part of the same identity theft incident and are linked to the same case. 

My Concern Bank of Americas approach is inconsistent and unfair : If they acknowledged and reimbursed XXXX  transaction as fraudulent, all related transactions from the same merchant and same fraud event should be treated the same way. 

Their internal disorganization and decision to split my case into multiple claims should not penalize me, the victim. 

By denying the remaining transactions, they are effectively holding me responsible for fraud that I did not authorize, despite my timely reporting and submission of all required documents. 

What I Am Requesting That the CFPB instruct Bank of America to reopen claim # XXXX and treat all related transactions under XXXX unified case. 

That Bank of America either : Provide verifiable, signed proof that I personally authorized these transactions, or Immediately credit the funds back to my account under the protections of Regulation E, which requires reimbursement for unauthorized electronic fund transfers when reported in a timely manner. 

Supporting Evidence FTC Identity Theft Report ( submitted to Bank of America ) Police Report ( submitted to Bank of America ) Bank of America correspondence showing partial reimbursement was issued for a related transaction but others were denied This situation is creating significant financial hardship for me, and I believe it represents a failure by Bank of America to correctly process a linked set of fraudulent transactions. I respectfully request CFPB intervention to ensure that I am made whole for the total disputed amount. 

Thank you for your time and assistance.

3136592,,,,"At the start of XX/XX/XXXX I entered into a debt settlement agreement with Americor Financial. I had accumulated enormous credit card debt when my dad and brother passed away from different cancers and I was spending alot of time in hospitals and helping my mom with their care. The representative @ Americor, XXXX XXXX, was a slick talker who said he'd been with the company for 9 yrs. He explained how the XXXX account was set up, how after 15 months, with good payment history, that I could get a line of credit where Americor paid everyone off and I'd just make one payment to them. That my credit score would rebound when this happened. During that 15 months I made double payments probably 7 or 8 times, as I could. There was one month when I asked to delay the payment and double the following month, that was when my dad died. They said no problem, no negative effects, and I made a double payment the following month. As far as I was aware this was the only glitch. When the 15 month time frame came up ( last XX/XX/XXXX ) I was told I'd have to wait another 18 months because I was late on a payment. I said that is not correct, which payment was I late on? They said the 1st payment. I was extremely upset because I am very proactive and calling customer service all the time to ask questions on details. At the start of the program, I tried to email and call Mr XXXX and was told he'd left the company. Throughout the 1st 15 months, I would speak with negotiators, take their direct #, then when I tried to call back to talk to that individual was told they were no longer with the company. This happened with at least 3 negotiators. There was NO continuity with advice I was given. Many times I'd get someone on the customer service line who was new, who gave me false incorrect information ( such as when to make my 1st payment ), and I'd constantly be put on hold because I'd ask questions that the agent had to check with someone else to be able to answer. Over and over I would get conflicting information from these people and they did everything possible to keep me from talking to an actual negotiator. Over the months they made payments to some of the creditors and I was so upset when last XXXX I would not get the line of credit, knowing that my credit score would be in the gutter for another 18 months. They would not listen to me when I told them I was just following instructions given by their representatives, as far as their story of me missing the 1st payment. Unfortunately at that time I still trusted this company and didn't record names and exact times/dates of conversations. I didn't think I needed to. So last XXXX I instructed them to pay off 3 of the 5 accounts in question and that I wanted to end my association with them. ( In the next few weeks I made phone calls and negotiated a settlement myself. The remaining account is still out there, a XXXX account that they have not charged off to anyone else at this time. ) What I am writing to you about, and filing a formal complaint, is that these people are fraudulent, in what they promised me, in what they described would happen during the process, and in all the bogus information I was given by various customer service representatives who did not know what they were talking about. My credit score is negatively impacted because I quit paying according to what they told me to do. I am still fighting with all 3 bureaus to change the language to "" Paid '' instead of "" Charged Off ''. Americor representatives told me in no uncertain terms that when I fulfilled the terms of any settlement offer, it would be reflected that the debt was paid in full. That that was to be an integral part of the settlement. Imagine my frustration finding out now, that this absolutely just does not happen, ever. That any change in terminology is totally up to each bureau. Now 2 years have gone by and I am still suffering. I improved my utilization percentage from 80 % to the low 40 % and only gained 8 points from that. If I had known then what I know now, I NEVER would have gotten involved with these liars. I am so upset about everything. They were flakes from the start. They insisted I fax a power of attorney form with my full social security # on it and then said they lost the fax. This is extremely troubling, especially since earlier this year I got a letter from the IRS saying that a fraudulent return for XX/XX/XXXX had been filed in my name using my soc sec #. Did someone from Americor take my number? I will never know. These people are total flakes. It was the worst mistake of my life getting involved with them. I am still suffering the consequences, and it looks like I will be for a very long time. I have called the credit bureaus, Americor, all the creditors, XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, I am so tired of being told "" give it another 30 days '' I've been told that for years now. I spoke with a representative from National Debt Relief, ( listed as a top 10 company in Consumer Reports for debt settlement ) and he told me he had never heard of Americor Financial!!!

About 4 months ago, after having recovered sufficiently from a fractured pelvis to ambulate, I went into my Citibank branch in XXXX XXXX, XXXX to ask a question. Do I need a Citibank power of attorney specifically for Citibank or will my general power of attorney suffice? The answer. I will need a POA from Citibank if I want my daughter who lives 4 blocks from me to be able to access funds. So they gave me the necessary papers and instructions as to what needed to be filled out. My daughter is XXXX years old and an XXXX ; I am XXXX and a retired XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX. I returned the papers, filled out as instructed. They were approved by my personal banker. '' A few days later I received a call from him, saying I needed to come in. I did. My signature was not notarized, which was true. That was because I had been told that it didnt need to be. I got new forms and both my daughters and my signatures were notarized. I returned them to the branch. A few days later, quite by accident, I noticed on my on-line statement that there was a letter for me. I opened it only to be horrified -- my accounts were going to be closed in 3 weeks. The letter did not tell me why, only that I should go to my branch. I didthis time more than a little annoyed. My "" personal banker '' called in the manager, XXXX XXXX, who reviewed all the papers again and assured me that there must have been some error and that now they were all fine. I asked him to sign a copy of the forms he had in his hand so that I had proof that all was taken care of. He did. Less than 2 weeks later, on a Saturday evening, XXXX XXXX I went online to pay bills. ACCOUNTS CLOSED was the message that came up when I tried to log into my Citibank account. I almost had a heart attack. Ninety percent of my bills are automatically paid from this account. All my income is automatically received into this account. I had no access to money. Ive never been late in any payment for anything including my mortgage which is also held by Citibank. My credit rating was perfect. My blood pressure, already high but controllable, became dangerously high. I immediately called my daughter, the XXXX, and my son, the XXXX XXXX at one of the nations largest credit unions. The next morning, Sunday, he and I were on the phone with Citibanks customer service ( which, of course, couldnt help ) except to say that a check was mailed and that it would come in 12-14 days. ( So the bank was earning interest on the float of almost {$70000.00} to boot! ) The following day, I and my daughter, who took the day off from work, spent from 9-2 in the manager XXXX XXXX XXXX office until he rectified the bank errors. ( He had been at this branch for less than a month ... and was resolute in getting this fixed. ) We got my account reopened with apologies from XXXX XXXX who said he had done at least 10 of these reversals. And he called me later that evening that the bank couldnt stop payment on the check. I had to borrow {$5000.00} to put into my account so bills could be paid. Even if all the paperwork for the power of attorney was incorrect ( which it wasnt ), why would that trigger closing an account? Couldnt they just have said no to the power of attorney? Why couldnt the bank stop payment on their own check even though they could if I called and asked them to stop one of mine? And how could they close an account for no reason ( or any reason ) without notifying the holder? This is a cautionary tale. If this could happen to me, someone who herself knows personal finance, someone whose children have tremendous connections and knowledge of banking laws, and someone who has a child whose job allows her to take a day off from work to advocate for her mother what happens to other older people or those less fortunate or knowledgeable? What happens to people who dont have access to additional funds and might have to wait 12-14 days before they get their own money back? How would this craziness affect their health? What would they do? Was this age-related? Was this just the ineptitude of one person or a system? Is this how banks do business nowadays? This has been an upsetting experience even though the bank manager was determined to resolve the issue asap and even though I expect to be made whole ( financially ).

I certainly appreciated the 2.9 % APR but really was not making good decisions at that point. Within a few days I recognized the error and contacted the finance staff to rectify the situation and cancel the extended warranty. I was informed that the warranty could be cancelled but would not reduce my monthly payment or be taken off the balance due in the purchase agreement. The {$2500.00} XXXX would be subtracted at the end of my payment period. This would mean that my payments would end approximately ten months earlier at four years and two months, instead of the initial plan of five years of payments. I found this to be quite an irregular policy as I would then be paying interest and tax on an item I have no longer purchased ; an item I do not own! I do not want to pay tax and interest on an item that I do not own. If I return an item at the hardware store they would logically return the price of the item and the tax. If I did not purchase an item on a credit card, the credit card company would logically not charge me interest. Why am I being charged for an item I do not own?

The XXXX agents and managers said they refused to apply the tactics used in the XXXX in the XXXX. Here is what XXXX former XXXX XXXX said. I watched every day, agents selling XXXX for double and close to triple what it was supposed to be sold for but management laughed and congratulated them for doing it. The maintenance fees statement about buying more and using that to pay your maintenance fees was a practice that was encouraged but be careful.

When it was time for maintenance fees to be paid, we attempted to use the program he described to us.

5204930,,,,"I have business and personal accounts and credit cards with Chase. The fraud occurred on my business account which has been open since XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX, I was sent an email from Chase notifying me that they processed my request to change my email address. I did not request to change my email address. I tried to log into my Chase app with my Face ID and could not get into my account. I went home to try to log in on my computer, and I still could not get into my Chase account. My password was not working. Upon trying to reset the password, I was given an option to have a code texted to my cell number. There was an additional number on my profile ending in XXXX. ( See attached ) This number does not belong to me, and I dont know who it belongs to. This number was added to my account by the person who illegally accessed my account. When I got into my account online, there was also a XXXX email address added to my account that does not belong to me ( see attached ). There were no fraudulent transactions made on my account at this time. I removed the email and phone number that was added to my account. I contacted Chase, and they shut down online access and instructed me to go to the branch the next day with two forms of ID to get access to the account online. On XX/XX/XXXX, I went into a Chase branch and spoke with a banker. I showed my two forms of ID, and we set up a new password for my account. On the evening of XX/XX/XXXX, I tried to log into my Chase app with my Face ID on my cell phone and was not able to get into my account. I tried again on my computer and was still not able to get into my account. I reset the password and logged into my account. There were 7 Online ACH Payments made on my account, totaling {$10000.00} ( see attached ). Individually, the charges were {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$1000.00}, {$3000.00}, {$3300.00}, {$990.00}, {$990.00}. The {$3000.00} and {$3300.00} Online ACH Payments were automatically returned by Chase as they suspected fraud ( reflected in blue on the 1-24 screenshot attached ). This left the total fraudulent Online ACH Payments at {$3900.00}. I transferred the balance {$7200.00} left in my account to my credit union to avoid any other transactions being made. I did not see any new emails or phone numbers tied to my account at this time. All of my alerts within my account were turned off, so I was not notified of any transactions or low balance alerts which I previously had set. I contacted Chase and we turned off the online access again. Claims and Fraud departments were closed at this time. On the morning of XX/XX/XXXX, I called Chase and filed a claim with them over the phone. After that, I went back into the branch, and spoke with the same banker. He first suggested that I open a new account, but then he said the new account would be tied to my existing profile so it wouldnt help. He said hes seen this before and that Chase wont help, and that I should open an account at a new bank. I set up a completely new email address, not attached to anything, and we set up completely new usernames and passwords while I was at the bank. When I left the branch, I went to open a new bank account for my business with another bank. Chase temporarily refunded the fraudulent charges totaling {$3900.00} for the following XX/XX/XXXX transactions ( {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$1000.00}, {$990.00}, {$990.00} ). I ran a Malware check on my computer and there was nothing. I added all notifications back to my account and also added the ACH approval and other recommendations Chase makes to protect your accounts. I also added 2 factor authentication to all my emails and accounts. I consistently get paid by vendors and it takes time to transition those payments so there was still a small amount of money in the account. On XX/XX/XXXX, my account was accessed yet AGAIN! I received a text notification that my balance was below {$500.00}. When I tried to log into my account, I couldnt. I reset the password and logged into my account. This time there was an additional email added onto my account. ( See attached ). There was also 6 Online ACH payments made to one individual totaling {$5100.00}. Individually, the Online ACH Payments were {$990.00}, {$1000.00}, {$980.00}, {$1000.00}, {$900.00}, and {$300.00} ( see attached ). All of the alerts except the one I received letting me know the account was under {$500.00} were turned off my account as well as the ACH approval that I just put in place. I contacted Chase immediately, and they were able to reverse the charges before they fully processed. These charges didnt go through because I caught them fast enough and the fraud department was still open. Chase shut down the online access again, and it has been shut down since XX/XX/XXXX as I dont trust it anymore. I have had to handle all my banking needs in person. On. XX/XX/XXXX, I received a text message that my account balance was $ XXXX. I immediately went into a branch to see what happened, and Chase had reversed the {$3900.00} that was fraudulently taken from my account on XX/XX/XXXX for amounts {$500.00}, {$500.00}, {$1000.00}, {$3000.00}, {$3300.00}, {$990.00}, {$990.00}. The international call center rep with limited English that we were connected with in the bank branch couldnt offer any information except that they were sorry for my inconvenience 50 times and the claim was denied. No detail whatsoever. So I went home and contacted Chase and was left on hold for 1hr 51 minutes ( see attached ) with no representative ever coming back to the phone. I called from another phone and was on hold for 3hr 3 minutes ( see attached ) with no representative ever coming back to the phone.. Simultaneously, I went to the bank branch near me, and after a 30 minute wait, one of the bankers called and was able to get a supervisor in the claims department on the phone. At XXXX, I spoke with the supervisor who could clearly see that this was obvious fraud on my account, and she said she was going to get the claim re-opened. She also said that the claim was denied because there was a new device added to my profile before the claim was filed. I told her the two devices that I use on my profile and if there was another one added that was fraudulent. She also said the claim was denied because there was insufficient documents to support the claim was valid. Chase never notified me if they needed additional documents. The supervisor put me on hold to get the case re-opened, and after 15 minutes of being on hold, the call was dropped. The branch was already closed at this time as it was after XXXX. So defeated again, I went home to try again the next day. The next morning, XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( see attached ), I called Chase again and spoke with a supervisor who agreed that the case should be re-opened, and she re-opened my claim. This has consumed both my life and business for the last 3 weeks. I have not been able to operate my business, I can not receive my vendor payments, I can not focus. The way I have been treated as if I am the criminal has me in disbelief. Financially, as a small business I can not sustain these losses. I can not pay my vendors and team because of what has happened to my account. I have spent countless hours, lost sleep been highly stressed, and as someone with lupus, this stress can be detrimental. There were so many red flags for Chase to flag these charges. The changing of emails, phone numbers, passwords and removing alerts should have flagged my account. All the sudden ACH payments should have flagged my account. I never make ACH payments from my account. That is simply not typical account behavior for me. Why would I pay the same person 7 times in a row? There were too many red flags, and Chase is absolutely not protecting its clients. Consumers are not safe here. Chase is on the side of the scammers. Where are the checks and balances? I have had my accounts for 7 9 years between them. I have credit cards with Chase, I have good credit, I have a business. Why would I jeopardize my own accounts? Now, I will be forced to go into a legal battle with a huge financial institution. I have more than enough documents to prove my case, especially, since Chase flagged two of the charges as fraud themselves.

We paid for this certificate, and learned absolutely nothing even though I graduated with honors ). Then they found me an internship at XXXX XXXX XXXX, who told me they are in need of an MAA like me, and after I completed 1 month of full-time work for them, they apologized and stated they cant afford to hire anyone right now. I was upset and went back to XXXX who said that it wasnt their problem anymore, as they already found me 1 job ( which by the way I was great at and they loved me. A few months later I found out that the counselor from XXXX had a deal with that doctors office and kept sending new interns there every month, with a promise that they are hiring, who were all told that they cant hire at the end of their 30-day internship. Such a scam! ). Needless to say, this ruined my chances of applying for another job because they all saw that my internship didnt hire me and questioned it. I had no way of paying my loans, I was XXXX XXXXears old. I got a small minimum-wage job and paid my loan for the first few years. Then in XXXX, I received a letter from the US Department of Education stating that my loan is eligible to be forgiven if I went to XXXX XXXX and took the MAA program from XX/XX/XXXX-XX/XX/XXXX, because XXXX was being sued by several people for fraudulent dealings, false advertising and empty promises. I was ecstatic and submitted my application. I kept calling and checking the status of my application for FOUR years! They kept saying that it is still pending, meanwhile my loan was in forbearance AND accruing interest!! They assured me I will get an answer shortly, since my best friend that did this program with me had her loan fully forgiven already. I finally got a response from them saying that I am NOT eligible for loan forgiveness because I missed the eligible window by a few weeks ( apparently I went to college just a few weeks later or earlier than the eligible date-span ). Which cant be true because my best friend went to the SAME program on the SAME dates and had her same loan forgiven. I dont mean to add in a sob story, but after completing that program back in XXXX, I also dealt with several health issues, brain tumors, treatments and several surgeries. I have so much medical debt and I am absolutely not able to pay back this loan regardless. Especially since I never used this certificate in the first place. I reached out to FedLoan and US Department of Education several times in the last few years, who both give me fake reassurances and help with absolutely nothing. I hope that you can see my unfortunate situation and how unfair it was. This is my last resort. I am literally begging for help.

Alas, this hope has been mercilessly snuffed out by the callous disregard of your agencies, who have callously toyed with my fate like a puppet on a string. As a proud veteran of the United States XXXX XXXX, and as a member of a family bound by generations of military service, I stand before you not as a mere individual, but as a testament to the sacrifices made in service to this nation. Yet, despite my unwavering dedication, I find myself ensnared in a web of deceit and indifference, my dreams of a better future dashed upon the jagged rocks of bureaucratic incompetence. The repercussions of your actions, or lack thereof, extend far beyond the confines of my credit report. They have infiltrated every aspect of my life, leaving me stranded in a sea of despair with no lifeline in sight. I am unable to secure better employment, provide for my family 's well-being, or even obtain necessary medical treatment, all because of the malignant tumor of debt festering within my financial record. I b eseech you, in the name of justice and integrity, to heed my call for action. Rectify the errors on my credit report with the urgency they deserve, and restore to me the dignity and respect that have been callously stripped away by your agencies ' negligence. Anything less would be a travesty of justice, a betrayal of the very principles upon which this nation was founded. I await your prompt response, not as a supplicant begging for mercy, but as a warrior demanding accountability and restitution for the injustices wrought upon me and my family.

2850408,,,,"We purchased a lot and built a home XX/XX/XXXXand moved into our home in XX/XX/XXXXwith a mortgage through Bank of America. 5 years ago, I fell and dislocated my shoulder and my arm became temporarily XXXX and required XXXX as well as XXXX XXXX XXXX. At the time, we did not have health insurance, and this put a great financial burden on us. In addition, we have a business that has had some hardship in the last few years. When we became behind in our house payments, we were not allowed just make one or two payments or partial payments to try to catch up, its all or nothing. We got behind on our house payments and when we tried to talk to Bank of America about a loan modification, they would not talk to us about our options until our payments were caught up. Through great hardship and the determent to other financial obligations, we were able to catch the payments up in XX/XX/XXXX. We tried for several months to get the paperwork started for loan modification with no luck. About XX/XX/XXXX, we were served foreclosure hearing papers. I immediately met with a bankruptcy attorney that I knew to see what I could do to keep the foreclosure from happening. She had several suggestions that I could do before using bankruptcy as a last resort as I wanted to avoid this if I could. She suggested I contact the attorney handling the foreclosure, which was XXXX and XXXX. I sent in all the paperwork for starting a loan modification that they asked for but didnt hear back from them. I was in contact with Bank of America, the lender of both the first mortgage and second mortgage and was told by XXXX XXXX, our account manager, to do a loan modification but to go through her and not the attorneys. She sent us the paperwork and we filled them out and sent in the paperwork they asked for. The paperwork never seemed to be the correct paperwork and they would ask for additional paperwork, many of which were not relevant such as Foreign Exchange P & L, officer compensation, P & L for a company that was no longer in business. All income for both of us were included in our tax returns that we provided, and we told them as much. This was over the course of several months and many conversations with not only XXXX XXXX, but others when she wasnt available. At one point this past fall, XXXX would say our mortgage was sold and when I questioned this, she would look further and avert the conversation and we would continue working on the modification. This happened several times and finally, she told me that our first mortgage had been sold to XXXX XXXX. When I questioned this, she told me she was not obligated to inform me, that it was XXXX XXXX job to send us a letter. Bank of America continued to hold my home equity or 2nd mortgage. I thought that the modification and paperwork would be applied to both accounts and one agent I talked to told me it should, but it wasnt. I immediately started working with XXXX XXXX and my account manager is XXXX XXXX. I began modification paperwork and collecting required paperwork, although I was told by Bank of America that all that would be forwarded. Again, what I would be asked for and turn in never seemed to be correct. One point they seemed to be stuck on was that I was listed as clerical on our tax returns and they felt this was a separate business and wanted a 1099 when in fact it was a job position and the income was listed on our tax return. On the next to the last phone call I got from XXXX, she told me my paperwork would expire on XX/XX/XXXX and I would have to reapply. The last of the paperwork was a XXXX P & L, signed and dated on each page with the dates XX/XX/XXXX through XX/XX/XXXX clearly written, 4506-T form with the correct box checked and proof of homeowners insurance. On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX and at first, someone she was training answered the phone and I tried explaining to him, but XXXX finally got on the phone and I told her I was checking that everything was complete since that was the deadline. She said I still didnt have the correct box checked on the 4506-T and P & L was not correctly stated so I told her Id resend and call her back. I resent the correct forms in 2 emails and called her back to make sure we had everything we needed that same day. She checked her email and said yes and said she would update everything right then since we were on a deadline. On XX/XX/XXXX, I believe this is the correct date, XXXX called me back and told me they could not move forward on the modification because there was a sale date on our house and it was within 38 days. I did not understand what she was talking about and assumed we had a foreclosure date. I asked her if she could tell me why my modification was denied, and she said it wasnt denied and would not continue because a sale date was within 38 days. She told me she could not give me advice but that she would request reinstatement amounts and since it would take time to get it and mail it to me and we didnt have time, she would email me when she got it. I have not received them yet. I called XXXX back to find out who foreclosed so Id know who to talk to, but my call went to voicemail. I called again the next day and again it went to voicemail, so I asked to speak to another agent as time was limited. The man I talked to told me my modification was denied because my paperwork was not turned in on time. When I told him, it was and that I had talked to XXXX to verify, he told me that they did not have to continue with the modification because the sale date was within 38 days and they were not required to inform me. He told me that just because I turned it in on the due date didnt mean it got to the underwriters on time. On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke with XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX because XXXX was not available. I told him I was looking for our loan balance and reinstatement amounts. He looked it up and said that the reinstatement paperwork came in and told me it was {$45000.00}. I explained that XXXX said shed email the paperwork since the sale date was so close. He said that the paperwork was only interoffice, and he couldnt release it but that it had been mailed to me, which I have not yet received. I asked him to please get XXXX to get back with about this and she has not. In late XX/XX/XXXXI got a foreclosure letter from XXXX and XXXX with a date of XX/XX/XXXX. I contacted Bank of America because they were the ones listed on the foreclosure letter and was told that if I could bring my 2nd mortgage to date, it would stop the foreclosure while I worked with XXXX XXXX on the loan modification. During this conversation, I was forwarded to no less than 4 departments and the last department I talked to told me this and wanted payment over the phone but would not take my debit card, would only take account information with routing number and account number. I could not provide this, so she put me on hold and told me since my account was so close to foreclosure, I needed to get a cashier check and take it to a Bank of America branch and ask them to send it interoffice mail and that would stop the foreclosure. I got a cashiers check for the correct amount of {$3900.00} and went to a local bank on XXXX XXXX street. I talked to the customer service rep and he told me he didnt think that this was the most efficient way to process that, so he asked me if I had time for him to inquire about this. So, he called and was also transferred to 4 or 5 different people who he explained the circumstances to and was finally told to post it through the teller. He did this, and its posted, and my account is current until XX/XX/XXXX. After speaking with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America and spoke with XXXX. I explained my situation and although this was not his department, he put me on hold and check around until he found someone that would help him, it took over an hour. He told me he had turned it over to a colleague and that he would contact XXXX and XXXX and get back with me, I have not heard back from him. It has been the most frustrating and painful experience I've ever had. I believed Bank of America when they said the foreclosure would be cancelled and didn't go to the foreclosure hearing and now have a sale date on my home on XX/XX/XXXX. All I needed to do was set something up to come out of a very bad time and felt I was betrayed. Now I am being forced to file for bankruptcy to try and keep my home for my family and children. When all I needed was time to makeup back payments while continuing with current payments. And BOA as well as XXXX XXXX has made it impossible to do that because it's all or nothing and the modification process is so long and so many roadblocks are put into place that it makes it impossible. There is no reason that this had to get this far. We've been customers for over 20 years and only needed clear support and directions, not the run around until it was too late. I am very disappointed in a company that I have placed my faith in for most of my adult life. We now working on filing bankruptcy but feel that this could all have been avoided if both Bank of American and XXXX XXXX would have just told us what we needed and not give us the run around. It has caused so much unnecessary stress and financial hardship.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

15623914,08/30/25,Credit card,Fees or interest,"Consumer Complaint : Synchrony Credit Card Deferred Interest Trap In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Synchrony credit card to finance my XXXX  XXXX after being offered a promotion of no interest for 24 months. At the time, I was told that : No interest would apply during the promotional period. 

I would receive a heads-up notice before the promotion expired. 

Setting up automatic payments would keep my account in good standing. 

Based on that, I set up autopay ( as recommended ) and made consistent payments for nearly two years, believing I was protected.

However, when I reviewed my account in XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered the following : On XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony posted {$1100.00} in accrued interest. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the day my promotion expired, they added {$2400.00} in deferred interest charges. 

After XX/XX/XXXX, additional monthly interest charges continued to appear on my statements, even though I was still making payments. 

Here is the record of my balances and statements : XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} ( deferred interest applied ) XX/XX/XXXX {$1100.00} ( interest charge posted ) Despite continuous payments, my balance did not go down it increased every month due to back interest and new interest charges. Synchrony claims statements were sent, but no warning was ever provided about the deferred interest expiration, even though I was promised advance notice. 

To make matters worse, the promotion expired specifically on the XXXX of the month, which feels like an intentional setup to catch consumers off guard between billing cycles. Combined with their recommendation to use autopay ( set by default to minimum payments ), this seems designed to ensure most customers fall into the trap. 

My request : I am asking Synchrony to refund the deferred interest charges ( {$1100.00} + {$2400.00} + the ongoing accrued monthly interest shown above ). I entered this financing in good faith and was misled by their advertising and failure to provide a clear notice.

And just my account was working perfectly fine these past couple days with no issues what so ever until I was at work needed to grab lunch and I work remotely in different locations because Im a commercial driver. My wife had sent me money for lunch and when I went to order and pay for my lunch my card kept on getting declined and I had tried to send the funds back to my wife and have her help me order my lunch it wouldnt even let me send the funds back. I tried calling customer service yesterday and was hold for over 3 hours just for someone to answer and say that that department have left for the day.

While I was on hold again today for over 2 hours got a hold of someone from the fraud department, he then told me that the back office had decided to close my account. I then had ask him why he stated he couldnt say and have to wait for a letter, then I ask can I at least get access to my funds so that I can pump gas to get to work on Monday. He stated I have to wait for a check to be mailed to me. I then ask to speak to a supervisor he got his manger on the line she stated her name was John Smith and she the manger of the fraud department. I then requested to at least let me get access to my funds for gas or at least let me send the funds back to my wife account so that I can still use it for gas. The rep then proceeded to say that she cant because the account is in the closing process and proceeded to giggle and laugh at what was going on taking it as a joke. I had ask her what kind of guarantee that she can provide me that I will receive the check after account being closed when I still havent received that verification letter that was mailed out to me through the mail to this date. she ignored the question and proceeded on saying that I will have to just wait for a check after the accounts close in 30 to 60 days after the accounts close then I should receive a check which then I stated to her so youre basically telling me that Im not gon na be able to access the funds or received a check until about almost 4 months.

I could hear her colleagues in the background, saying something to her, and as I try to explain the situation of reasons why I needed to access the funds and stuff she still kept on, proceeded to giggle laugh taking everything as a joke.

Prior complaints were improperly closed as duplicates, despite addressing legally distinct issues. 

Goldman Sachs continues to furnish a charged-off account to the credit bureaus without providing legally required documentation to verify the accuracy, ownership, or validity of the alleged debt.

This included a formal request for certified ledger transactions, general ledger entries, loss deficit reports, red and black entries, and certified financial statements that could demonstrate that a legitimate financial loss or damage had been sustained by the alleged creditor.

Under UCC 9-210, as the secured party, Absolute Resolutions has a fiduciary obligation to respond to my formal request. As the debtor, I exercised my legal right to request an accounting of the obligation they claim exists. To date, they have failed to comply within the required 14-day statutory period, and no such certified audit or financial proof has been provided. 

This failure to respond constitutes a failure to meet the legal burden of proof for enforcing any claim of debt. Without certified accounting, the only legally recognizable balance is a credit balance in the amount of {$10000.00}, which under 15 U.S. Code 1666d must be returned as a refund. Any further collection activity on an unverified or fictitious debt becomes legally questionable.

Moreover, if no financial loss has occurredand if no verified chain of title, general ledger, or certified audit from a licensed accountant can be providedthe continued attempt to collect this alleged debt may constitute : Mail Fraud ( 18 U.S.C. 1341 ) : Using the U.S. Postal Service to pursue a fictitious debt.

The main claim number at issue is XXXX for a total disputed amount of {$24000.00}. 

Summary of Events I experienced identity theft resulting in multiple fraudulent ACH payments to XXXX XXXX from my Bank of America account. 

I immediately reported the fraud to Bank of America and submitted both : FTC Identity Theft Report Police Report Bank of America processed my dispute but split it into multiple claims. 

They credited and approved XXXX portion of the claim ( related to the same fraudulent XXXX XXXX transactions ), but denied the rest, even though all transactions are part of the same identity theft incident and are linked to the same case. 

My Concern Bank of Americas approach is inconsistent and unfair : If they acknowledged and reimbursed XXXX  transaction as fraudulent, all related transactions from the same merchant and same fraud event should be treated the same way. 

Their internal disorganization and decision to split my case into multiple claims should not penalize me, the victim. 

By denying the remaining transactions, they are effectively holding me responsible for fraud that I did not authorize, despite my timely reporting and submission of all required documents. 

What I Am Requesting That the CFPB instruct Bank of America to reopen claim # XXXX and treat all related transactions under XXXX unified case. 

That Bank of America either : Provide verifiable, signed proof that I personally authorized these transactions, or Immediately credit the funds back to my account under the protections of Regulation E, which requires reimbursement for unauthorized electronic fund transfers when reported in a timely manner. 

Supporting Evidence FTC Identity Theft Report ( submitted to Bank of America ) Police Report ( submitted to Bank of America ) Bank of America correspondence showing partial reimbursement was issued for a related transaction but others were denied This situation is creating significant financial hardship for me, and I believe it represents a failure by Bank of America to correctly process a linked set of fraudulent transactions.

Further, based on XXXX  own publicly filed financial documents including their XXXX, XXXX, Form XXXX, and trust filings with the SEC the account in question appears to have been sold and transferred into a legally isolated, bankruptcy-remote trust. TMCC clearly states in its filings that once receivables are transferred to securitized trusts, they are no longer TMCCs assets and are removed from their balance sheet. This means TMCC is no longer the owner or creditor of the account, and their continued furnishing of data to the credit bureaus constitutes misrepresentation under FCRA and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). They are falsely representing ownership of a debt they no longer hold, while also acting as a debt collector without proper disclosure a violation of FDCPA 807 and 809.

At this stage, I had already submitted all necessary documentation, but Amex stalled. 

XXXX XXXX ( XX/XX/year> ) : Supervisor Escalation I escalated to a floor supervisor who falsely described this as a better offer investigation. 

I corrected the record this was not an upgrade request but the exact offer I was promised. 

Even with my screenshot proof, Amex refused to provide confirmation that the XXXX miles would be honored. 

I reiterated that my honeymoon was weeks away, and Amexs delays were now making it impossible to use the miles in time. 

XXXX ( XX/XX/year> ) : Continued Stonewalling I was told again to check back in 24 weeks, pushing resolution further past my travel timeline. 

Despite my clear explanation of time-sensitive harm, Amex repeatedly cited internal processes and maximum 68 weeks language. 

Amex also advertised a XXXX SkyMiles offer on the same card during this period proving higher offers were available, yet my documented XXXX offer remains unhonored. 


Why This Is a Regulatory Concern : Truth in Lending Act ( Regulation Z ) : Promotional terms must be accurately disclosed at the time of application. 
The XXXX SkyMiles offer was a material term I relied upon in making my application. 

FTC Act ( Section 5 Deceptive Practices ) : This is a textbook bait-and-switch. 
Amex advertised XXXX miles, induced me to apply, then tried to downgrade me to XXXX miles and stall resolution until the offer became irrelevant for my needs. 

Unfair Business Practices : Delaying resolution for 612 weeks ensures that customers with time-sensitive travel needs can not use the miles they were promised. 

This creates financial harm and undermines consumer trust. I will move most of my business to XXXX. They have better welcome offers and actually honor them. They have the back of the consumer. Visa cards might be the best way to go. 


Harm Caused : Loss of Time : Over six weeks wasted in repetitive chats, with no progress beyond we are investigating. 

Loss of Value : I can not receive the points before my XXXX honeymoon, undermining the reason I applied.

Loss of Trust : Multiple agents minimized the issue by calling it a better offer when it was the exact advertised offer. Cold and unhelpful responses from representatives.

15623914,08/30/25,Credit card,Fees or interest,"Consumer Complaint : Synchrony Credit Card Deferred Interest Trap In XX/XX/XXXX, I opened a Synchrony credit card to finance my XXXX  XXXX after being offered a promotion of no interest for 24 months. At the time, I was told that : No interest would apply during the promotional period. 

I would receive a heads-up notice before the promotion expired. 

Setting up automatic payments would keep my account in good standing. 

Based on that, I set up autopay ( as recommended ) and made consistent payments for nearly two years, believing I was protected.

However, when I reviewed my account in XX/XX/XXXX, I discovered the following : On XX/XX/XXXX, Synchrony posted {$1100.00} in accrued interest. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, the day my promotion expired, they added {$2400.00} in deferred interest charges. 

After XX/XX/XXXX, additional monthly interest charges continued to appear on my statements, even though I was still making payments. 

Here is the record of my balances and statements : XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2200.00} XXXX XXXX, XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2300.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} XX/XX/XXXX {$2400.00} ( deferred interest applied ) XX/XX/XXXX {$1100.00} ( interest charge posted ) Despite continuous payments, my balance did not go down it increased every month due to back interest and new interest charges. Synchrony claims statements were sent, but no warning was ever provided about the deferred interest expiration, even though I was promised advance notice. 

To make matters worse, the promotion expired specifically on the XXXX of the month, which feels like an intentional setup to catch consumers off guard between billing cycles. Combined with their recommendation to use autopay ( set by default to minimum payments ), this seems designed to ensure most customers fall into the trap. 

My request : I am asking Synchrony to refund the deferred interest charges ( {$1100.00} + {$2400.00} + the ongoing accrued monthly interest shown above ). I entered this financing in good faith and was misled by their advertising and failure to provide a clear notice.

According to 15 U.S.C. 1681c-2, once a consumer submits an identity theft report, credit reporting agencies are legally required to block any information identified by the consumer as resulting from such identity theft within four ( 4 ) business days.

Request for Verification : Under 15 U.S.C. 1692g ( b ), you must provide : 1. Proof of your legal standing to collect this debt, including a valid assignment or chain of title demonstrating ownership of the debt from the original creditor to your agency.

Potential Fraud Concerns : I also challenge the legitimacy of this debt on the grounds that the original creditor may have already received compensation for any alleged loss.

Courts have held that a party can not seek double recovery for the same loss, as seen in FDIC v. United Pac. Ins. Co., 20 F.3d 1070 ( 10th Cir. 1994 ).

Additionally, if the debt has been securitized and sold as part of an asset-backed security, the original creditor may no longer have a valid claim, as illustrated in Carpenter v. Longan , 83 U.S. 271 ( 1872 ), which supports the principle that the note and security instrument can not be separated.

Creditor Accepted payment. Account already discharged : The alleged debt was already paid and discharged by the alleged creditor. Please cease all collection activity.

Listing numerous state bar licenses while functioning purely as a collection agency is a misrepresentation intended to pressure the consumer.

My wife had sent me money for lunch and when I went to order and pay for my lunch my card kept on getting declined and I had tried to send the funds back to my wife and have her help me order my lunch it wouldnt even let me send the funds back. I tried calling customer service yesterday and was hold for over 3 hours just for someone to answer and say that that department have left for the day. But now I needed to access the funds to pump gas for my new job that I just started work for. So I had miss work today the XXXX of XXXX because couldnt access the funds for gas. While I was on hold again today for over 2 hours got a hold of someone from the fraud department, he then told me that the back office had decided to close my account. I then had ask him why he stated he couldnt say and have to wait for a letter, then I ask can I at least get access to my funds so that I can pump gas to get to work on Monday. He stated I have to wait for a check to be mailed to me. I then ask to speak to a supervisor he got his manger on the line she stated her name was XXXX and she the manger of the fraud department. I then requested to at least let me get access to my funds for gas or at least let me send the funds back to my wife account so that I can still use it for gas. The rep then proceeded to say that she cant because the account is in the closing process and proceeded to giggle and laugh at what was going on taking it as a joke. I had ask her what kind of guarantee that she can provide me that I will receive the check after account being closed when I still havent received that verification letter that was mailed out to me through the mail to this date. she ignored the question and proceeded on saying that I will have to just wait for a check after the accounts close in 30 to 60 days after the accounts close then I should receive a check which then I stated to her so youre basically telling me that Im not gon na be able to access the funds or received a check until about almost 4 months. She then proceeded to still giggle and laugh at the situation. I could hear her colleagues in the background, saying something to her, and as I try to explain the situation of reasons why I needed to access the funds and stuff she still kept on, proceeded to giggle laugh taking everything as a joke. I then proceeded to ask for her name a customer service rep number, reference number and stuff she kept on saying that she can not give out those numbers or anything else besides just her name I told her we do have family members that works at Citibank so we know how the situation is supposed to go, our family member that works at Citibank basically told us that upon asking for a rep ID number or a reference number is one is supposed to be provided to us and we wouldnt well I wouldnt be requesting for something like that if I already didnt, if I didnt know that you know theyre supposed to be giving it. She still just kept on laughing with the situation kept on saying that theres no reference number or any type of number that she could give me to tie the conversation, the phone call thats going on and stuff. I also instructed her that when my account got locked yesterday I didnt get no emails phone calls about a fraud alert or anything like that. I told her situation couldve been handled quickly yesterday, but didnt get no alerts or anything like that.

XXXX XXXX XXXX, CA XXXX Email : XXXX Phone : XXXX DOB : XX/XX/XXXX SSN ( Last 4 ) : XXXX Date : XX/XX/XXXX To : Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Subject : Formal Dispute of Inaccurate Credit Reporting Account : Credit Collection Services Balance {$210.00} Reported XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  Dear CFPB, I am writing to file a formal dispute regarding the account being reported by Credit Collection Services on my credit report. This account contains several inaccuracies and missing information that violate the Fair Credit Reporting Act ( FCRA ) and Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ( FDCPA ). 
Issues with the Account Reporting : 1. No Original Creditor Identified The report lists Credit Collection Services as both the collection agency and original creditor, which is contradictory and incomplete. 
2. Missing Account Details The account does not provide the account type, account number, or the original service provider the debt allegedly came from. 
3. No Contact or Payment Information There is no address, phone number, or payment channel listed for this collection, preventing me from validating or resolving the debt.

4. Open vs. Collection Status Conflict The account is marked both as Open and Placed for Collection. This is misleading and unfairly impacts my credit.

5. Unverified Balance The {$210.00} balance is not itemized ( no breakdown of principal, interest, or fees ), making it unverifiable. 
Because the account is missing critical information and is reported inaccurately, I am requesting that it be deleted from all of my credit reports unless Credit Collection Services can fully validate it with proper documentation. 
Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

5957965,2009/7/22,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"My mortgage company is Freedom Mortgage. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for covid 19 Mortgage forbearance due to reduce of income, process went through correctly, I was able to pause my mortgage for 6 months, On XX/XX/XXXX, I use my mortgage website to submit a request for an additional 6 Month of extension, and bring the expiration date to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called the mortgage company on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and request information in way to exit forbearance, I was told by the representative that my Portal claim is already approved, and just want for the total due amount to reset back to normal, then I can start making normal month payment as before. 
After 2 months of patiently waited, I called the mortgage company and asked about it, then I was told that my account was delinquent with no action token after forbearance. After spoke with at least 3 different people, no one can tell me what happened, and just told me that I need to submit supporting documents in order to get review, I refused and asked why do I need to provide those documents while I already have a partial claim, they did not have an answer for me, and told me that they will note it and do some research on it. 
I then finally ran out of patient as no one could tall me exactly what happened, I requested to speak to the supervisor directly. When I did, the supervisor informed me that my partial claim was cancelled due to the extension of my forbearance. Base on what the supervisor told me, and I have to come up with my conclusion, as the supervisor is trying not to tell me directly that they messed up. 
Here is my own conclusion, Someone ( not me ) exited my forbearance for me without my authorization, and make the expiration date on XXXX instead of the end of XXXX like it should be. I realized that on XXXX and called the mortgage company and asked why, I was informed at the time that the exit of forbearance was mistakenly submitted ( I did not request it ), but the rep told me that they can fix it for me, but instead of making the expiration date back to XX/XX/XXXX like it should be, they gave me another 6-month extension with the new expiration date as XXXX XXXX. 
I guess the partial claim was submitted for only from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I never got to see the partial claim, when it got submitted, approved, or cancelled, thats why I can only guess. None of these transactions were show in my account portal or getting any mails regarding that. 

Now the mortgage company told me that there is no other option for me to take other than mortgage modification which will significantly increase my interest rate, and making these much harder for me to keep the property. I asked if I can still take the VA partial claim option since I was always staying on top of my account, but due to the fact that I was getting wrong information and time ran out while I was expecting that my account is approved for all the process and just need to be applied to my account. I asked them to submit the VA partial claim as they deadline is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Mortgage company refused and claim that the deadline has already past, I request them to confirm with the VA Mortgage department, they refused and insist than they were correct with the deadline and requirement. 

Moving forward, I can not change whats already happened, but I would like to get an option that I can afford and get back on track with my payment. While assuming all the information on https : //www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/partial_claim.asp are correct, my mortgage company just refuse to help me.

6 major email addresses of Wells Fargo as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Wells Fargo online : XXXX XXXX 2 main of contact phone numbers after the claim dispute and fraud investigation done by Wells Fargo agents who declared the XXXX legitimate service and paid for them {$2400.00}. 
Customer Service ( XXXX ) XXXX XXXX XXXX Escalated Solution ( XXXX ) XXXX Summary of the issues of XXXX XXXX XXXX of XXXX product as follows : ID # XXXX ( {$49.00} posted XX/XX/XXXX ) ; ID # XXXX ( {$1100.00} posted XX/XX/XXXX ) ; ID # XXXX ( {$710.00} posted XX/XX/XXXX ) ; ID # XXXX ( {$310.00} Posted XX/XX/XXXX ) ; ID # XXXX ( {$200.00} posted XX/XX/XXXX ). I have suffered for almost 3 months starting from XX/XX/XXXX until present XX/XX/XXXX for paying 4 times through my XXXX ending # XXXX the total of {$2400.00}. XXXX paid back {$49.00} for an introduction to their service of installment of electronic devices leaving the disputed amount of {$2400.00}. 
In my case, the sum of {$2400.00} was the total amount of the labor cost of the installation of the XXXX video camera at some spots inside and outside of my house in conjunction with the XXXX product sold by the XXXX team. However, the XXXX product installment of XXXX was unable to make the connection with the XXXX Community Monitoring ( XXXX security service ), and XXXX also improperly sold the XXXX devices directly to me through their service of installment for my convenience ; therefore, the issue of no appropriate connection to XXXX  monitoring was properly from the Ring devices sold not from the original seller. 
After 2 months ( XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) of verbal complaints back and forth with the XXXX managers, I received no response and no refund from XXXX managers. Therefore, I called the XXXX XXXX California XXXX XXXX XXXX ) for their advice on XXXX installer issues where I got the message to get my compensatory damage from the Wells Fargo XXXX  to stop payment because the improper selling XXXX devices and failure to make a connection with XXXX XXXX was not under XXXX jurisdiction. 
So far, under the WF claim dispute and WF Fraud investigation time frame of 60 days starting from the day that WF received my warning and complained against the XXXX merchant 's unlawful conduct ; WF agents should stop the payment to the XXXX merchant. But WF failed to protect my financial resource ; therefore, I started my complaint against WF agents to WF management to absorb my {$2400.00} loss resulting from WF agent 's failure to stop payment within the 60 days allowable time frame. After XX/XX/XXXX, when I was informed by the WF executive intake escalator who took in my complaint and generated a case number for the assigned escalator specialist to give me the legitimate solution, I expected to see the {$2400.00} put in the dispute section where no interest being applied and no harassed billing collection issues to me from XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, and the present of XXXX of XXXX. 
I have suffered emotionally, physically, and financially through complaining, appealing to the Wells Fargo chain of command from XX/XX/XXXX until today, and moving upward and downward ( from the bottom to top, then, from the top back to the bottom ) through the processing time of researching but compiling of the escalating specialist and their managers for 9 months with no solution but researching, and finally the adverse effect solution of XXXX XXXX and his supervisor XXXX from XX/XX/XXXX, until XX/XX/XXXX, while they both hit and run leaving the damage to the WF loyal customer as I am. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted XXXX XXXX, a customer service supervisor ID # XXXX ) who confirmed that the amount of {$58.00} that XXXX monitor refunded toward my previous credit card ending # XXXXXXXX ( WF XXXX # XXXX ) which was replaced by WF Fraud Department with the assistant of XXXX XXXX, an escalator specialist, who assured me over the phone that the balance of my credit was {$0.00} amount- there was no transferring, no confusing from the previous with the disputed amount of {$2400.00} set aside in the new card ending of # XXXX ( WF XXXX # XXXX ) issued by WF Fraud Department action, not by customer request on XX/XX/XXXX. Furthermore, XXXX XXXX took in my complaint and generated a new replacement for the previous complaint number # XXXX to # XXXX over the WF phone # ( XXXX ) XXXX. He also provided a customer service complaint # XXXX with the instruction to call ( XXXX ) XXXX before calling the Executive Branch at ( XXXX ) XXXX. He generated points of my complaint as ( 1 ) request to provide the final solution for my complaint against the time wasted for research and harassment of WF agents for pending the solution ; ( 2 ) the above dispute amount of {$2400.00} should be deducted {$500.00} that WF executive office reward to me in XX/XX/XXXX not adding interest rate to bounce back to {$2700.00} ; ( 3 ) why it took so long from XX/XX/XXXX, to XX/XX/XXXX, for the specialist to research and find out the misconducts of WF escalated specialists; ( 4 ) stop emailing, mailing, and phone calling the default, delinquency of WF XXXX billing department that triggered my anger, stress, XXXX and worsen my physical and mental condition ; ( 5 ) in XX/XX/XXXX, I filed the complaint with WF about the financial XXXX XXXX against those WF billers harassment because I had been waiting for WF executive officer to remove the remainder of the XXXX merchant charge entering to my XXXX card for WF agents fault. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I spoke to XXXX XXXX at ( XXXX ) XXXX, who was an executive intake officer of XXXX XXXX because I received a mail letter from WF bank dated XX/XX/XXXX, that warned me about ( 1 ) my credit score reduced from XXXX to XXXX due to owning WF XXXX  unpaid ; ( 2 ) my WF credit line reduced from {$7000.00} to {$2600.00} even though I paid all of my balance through other merchants and stopped using a new XXXX Card issued to me on XX/XX/XXXX ; ( 3 ) providing me the WF legal contact information for me to address my issues either unresolved or provided the adverse solution before I seeking the legal assistance outside of WF system ; ( 4 ) stop adding the interest into the disputed amount pending at WF Executive Office for WF agents misconduct and disrespect toward an elderly customer ; ( 5 ) WF local branch has no idea and no authority to address the WF XXXXXXXX and the WF escalated specialist and managers. They advised me to continue to address my issue with the proper channels of Wells Fargo for a proper solution. As per XXXX XXXX 's information that the decision on XX/XX/XXXX, was made by XXXX XXXX XXXX to resolve case # XXXX, I was not aware and was informed by XXXX XXXX whose phone # ( XXXX ) XXXX ext XXXX where the extension was either not exist or no longer in service. Finally, XXXX XXXX informed me to give XXXX XXXX a second chance to carry out his duty according to WF policy and procedure and address the issue with me. I requested her to leave the message to XXXX XXXX, a supervisor of XXXX XXXX XXXX who is my current case manager, but XXXX XXXX failed to call me in the next 2 days. Therefore, I called phone # ( XXXX ) XXXX back and got XXXX XXXX XXXX, a team leader of escalated specialist, who told me that he would take care of my case and called him at his cell # ( XXXX ) XXXX if I would see my new case being informed via a phone or my email address. The solution should be reached 10 days after the case manager officially informed me a couple of days after a case was taken in by an intake officer. The attempt solution was estimated by XX/XX/XXXX. However, I left voice messages on XXXX XXXX 's cell phone on XX/XX/XXXX, and XXXX, XXXX but received no reply from him. XXXX XXXX was on vacation as per XXXX XXXX verbally informed me when I criticized him for failing to take a second to handle my case accordingly as per Wells Fargo Policy and Procedure guidelines for them. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested XXXX XXXX to call me back, and he called me back on XX/XX/XXXX to inform me that I would receive the email information of my case manager the next day and the solution would be rendered on XX/XX/XXXX. However, I received nothing as per his empty promises over the phone, I called XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to check on the solution, but he told me the information via email was sent back to him as not being deliverable through my email address at XXXX. I requested him to email me right away, and I confirmed that his test email was received by me on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX pm to prove that he was misinformed by XXXX XXXX, a second chance case manager, who also failed his second chance. XXXX XXXX promised to provide the solution by the end of the day XX/XX/XXXX. But I still received no solution. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I called ( XXXX ) XXXX where XXXX XXXX transferred my call to XXXX XXXX, an intake executive officer at ( XXXX ) XXXX, who informed me that the XXXX XXXX manager, XXXX XXXX was a head of the department, who declared to need more time indefinitely to research and reach the solution for my case, no one above him to intervene this adverse solution of XXXX XXXX XXXX, a case manager for a case # XXXX generated on XX/XX/XXXX by XXXX XXXX XXXX Therefore, I called customer service phone # ( XXXX ) XXXX to complain against XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX, and XXXX XXXX hit and ran on the adverse solution and dumping on my cases where I was informed that XXXX XXXX XXXX, a manager of XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX state, would call me today XX/XX/XXXX, on the solution for my case that has been jeopardized and prolonged to hide, conceal, and deceive the elderly loyal bank customer like me.

XX/XX/XXXX called the given number and spent XXXX hours, speaking to XXXX different individuals.

Next, XXXX relayed the individual who is impersonating me had withdrawn money from the fraudulent business account and as is Chases policy, a 10 day wait period would mean the check would be sent out in exactly XXXX business days, on XX/XX/XXXX.

I was told the fraudulent XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX business account was flagged and the imposter had been contacted via phone and email to come to the branch to be authenticated but had not shown up. XXXX told me I would be receiving a packet to complete regarding this claim and to fill out and include the police report, when I was done to bring back to them and they would fax for me.

On XX/XX/2022 around XXXXXXXX XXXX while I was driving back home, I noticed my Bank of America app on my phone was notifying, so I stopped to check and the app was telling me that there has been several unsuccessful attempts to log in to my account, so for me to log in I have to change my password and username. After doing that I found out that there was one unauthorized transfer from my son 's XXXX XXXX 's account to my own checking account with the amount of XXXX USD and to make it worse I noticed four unauthorized XXXX transfers from my checking account with the amount of XXXX USD. I immediately called the bank and they told me to change the password and the username immediately and I gave them all the information about this incident and the person who was talking to me told me that in ten to eleven business days I'll be credited with temporary amount for this occurred fraud, till this investigation is concluded. After two to three weeks I received two emails and two letters from Bank of America stating that the case is closed and that they found out that there was nothing suspicious, well in this case I strongly disagree with the Bank 's investigation. Because of the following points : 1.It is suspicious that I'll do four XXXX transfers from my account to the same person whom I do not know and when I asked the Bank about his phone number or who he is or his contact, the Bank gave me no answer so far. 
2.Usually when there is a XXXX transfer I receive a text message and an e-mail, checking my text message and my e-mail I did not find anything, and when I asked the Bank about why I didn't receive and e-mail or a text, they said that the e-mails and the text were deleted instantly. I strongly feel suspicious about this activity, transferring to the same person at the same time frame, and deleting all e-mails and texts, the Bank however should have sent all corresponding e-mails, that they've received or sent, instead of telling me that it was instantly deleted. This is highly evident that I've been a target to fraud, and the bank is not cooperating or launching a real investigation with all the their tools and means of investigation.

I don't have physical checks so I usually write a cashier 's check or a money order to pay my rent. Well the card was declined. The interesting thing about this new card was that my picture was on the face of the card for the first time ever. So I stepped out of line to call the bank and discovered that there was a block put on my account furthermore I was directed to the fraud department who explained to me that there was a transaction that took place without my consent and that's why the card is being blocked. Didn't call me beforehand they didn't they left me feeling as if the transaction had already been taken care of.

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to use this debit card to withdraw {$1000.00} from the ATM at the Bank of America ATM on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX CA. The ATM denied the withdrawal saying I had reached my maximum withdrawal for the day, however, I never went to the bank that day. I called the Bank of America customer service number on the back of my card and they said there were ten {$1000.00} withdrawals, one a day, for the past 10 days. As soon as I realized my money was being stolen on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America Prepaid Claims to cancel that debit card and send me a new card. I have not used the new card and I cut up the old card. 

I filed a fraud claim with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. I included the following transactions. 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX 24 minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal 30 seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal Then Bank of America rejected my claim because they said I made the withdrawal at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. After looking into it, I realized the agent and myself made a mistake by including two transactions that I had actually made. I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX and I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked Bank of America to remove the two withdrawals I made on those dates and to send in a reconsideration of the claim with those two withdrawal transactions removed. Bank of America said the removal of the two transactions were approved and removed from the claim, however, Bank of America still kept denying the claim. 

The following transactions are definitely fraud and I have been trying to dispute them for since XX/XX/XXXX to get the {$8000.00} from me that was stolen : XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal XXXX seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX  $ XXXX withdrawal There were eight total {$1000.00} withdrawals that I did not do which are fraud. 

On XXXX XXXX I filed a police report with the City of XXXX. The police report number is : XXXX and the officer is XXXX # XXXX. Currently, Detective XXXX of the XXXX Police Department is working on my case to press criminal charges against the person who committed fraud against me. When I spoke to Detective XXXX yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX, She informed me that she spoke with Bank of America and they told her the footage is now deleted as it expires after 120 days. However, I believe Bank of America is lying that they no longer have the footage because they mailed me a still capture image of myself at the ATM from XX/XX/XXXX and they mailed that to me on XX/XX/XXXX, which is way past 120 days. Now Bank of America is lying to the police. 

I feel like Bank of America has been pushing me around in a circle and now the footage that proves my innocence to get my money back is "" erased '', according to Bank of America. 

I request the {$8000.00} stolen from me is returned. I have filed numerous complaints to Bank of America against agents who misled me during the claim process and against agents who said they did something that they did not actually do. I.E. removing the two transactions that were me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX a supervisor who said their team working on my claim will review all the footage. That never happened. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the claim was denied again because XXXX, a supervisor in Kansas said they were only looking at the two videos of me, and they had not looked at any additional footage from the other dates that I was disputing since the first video showed me at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. She said she requested for the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX to be removed. She also said the withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX was removed from the claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, a Bank of America agent from Georgia. She said she did a withdrawal to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction and sent in a request to escalate it. This was contradictory to what XXXX told me, because she said the XX/XX/XXXX transaction was already removed, but this other agent said it was not. XXXX said she also did not see a letter generated to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction, so she submitted a request to remove that transaction from the claim. She also filed three complaints against agents who did not properly file the removal of transactions and she claims that she escalated those complaints. My claim was still getting denied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX in Alabama. She submitted a reconsideration request of my claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX in Nevada. I told her that in the mail, I received still captures of two transactions that I did. One on XX/XX/XXXX ( which was not included in the claim ) and one from XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why Bank of America won't send me the footage/still captures of the other eight ATM withdrawals that I know were not me. She said since Bank of America identified me in the transaction from XX/XX/XXXX, they didn't look at anymore footage, they just denied the whole claim. She also confirmed that the two transactions on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were finally removed and excluded from the claim. However, If this was truly the case, I don't know why the claim would still get denied when the other 8 transactions will not show me because I was never at the bank in the wee hours of the morning when those 8 transactions took place. XXXX also submitted a request to have the images of the other 8 transactions mailed to me. I was waiting over two weeks for these images but I never received anything in the mail. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to supervisor XXXX in Texas. He submitted another reconsideration request and he recommended I write another letter to Bank of America explaining the situation. I submitted another detailed letter to them via fax and still have heard nothing back. According to Agent XXXX, there are still attempted transactions being made on the old card even up to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the OCC and State Banking Regulator of CA. They recommended I file a complaint here. 

Bank of America, to my knowledge, never reviewed all the tapes of the transactions that were in this claim. 

Overall, the patterns of these fraudulent transactions do not align with my behaviors using the debit card and I know the footage of the eight withdrawals I am contesting will show the person making those withdrawals, I solemnly swear is not me, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have also been a loyal Bank of America customer for personal checking accounts since XXXX and my current business accounts are also with Bank of America since XXXX.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

These 14 purchases amounted to a total of {$780.00}, which we would never, intentionally, spend on a mobile game. Our USAA Debit card is setup on the XXXX XXXX XXXX so we can pay for several subscriptions and any other services. Unfortunately, we did not configure the security features in XXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for authorization, typically a fingerprint or password, before any manual purchase is made, since the owner of the phone is an adult. The family member who unintendingly made the purchases, fell asleep with the mobile game running, and part of her arm was touching the screen, which touched the coin package purchase button within the game, which is readily accessible, several times, and since there were now purchase authorization prompts, they went right through. I only noticed once I started receiving notifications on my phone about all the transaction taking place in succession. When I went to ask my family member about it, I noticed she was asleep and what was happening with her phone and mobile game. 

Immediately on that same day, we reached out to XXXX to try and have the transactions cancelled and refunded. We submitted the information they asked for on their XXXX XXXX refunds website while we chatted with a XXXX representative online. I also sent an email to the developer of the mobile game ( XXXX XXXX ), and they told us they can't process refunds and that we would have to do it through XXXX. The same day, XX/XX/2022, we called USAA and explained how these unintentional purchases happened, and they opened a dispute case. A day later, USAA refunded all the 14 purchases, which amounted to {$780.00}. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/2022, we noticed a charge from USAA that was not expected by us. I saw that this charge was a dispute credit reversal, which was for one of the unintentional purchases made back on XX/XX/2022. I called USAA 's customer support number and asked about the unannounced {$99.00} charge they made. When I asked more details about the charge and dispute, I was told that they found no errors in the transactions mentioned in the dispute and therefor, the amount they had refunded to us was going to be removed from my account within a week, which is XX/XX/2022. We asked for the dispute to be reviewed and that we did not agree with the final decision. I also explained what happened again and made sure they added the notes to the dispute in case it was not clear. 

No matter how much I tried and explained what happened, they said that they will still remove {$780.00} from my account. It didn't matter that the final decision is being reviewed, they will still take the money out of our account. I asked if there was anybody in USAA, a manager, director, anybody I could talk to, but I was told there wasn't anybody and that the person reviewing the dispute doesn't take direct calls. I was told a decision on the review will be communicated to us between 5-10 days. 

Interestingly, right after talking to USAA, we talked to a XXXX representative today, XX/XX/2022, and explained what had transpired with USAA. XXXX told us that they see all the 14 transactions as cancelled and that USAA shouldn't have processed any charges to our account. The XXXX representative created a case and set it as high priority so they can investigate and hopefully have an update before XX/XX/2022, which is when USAA is planning to take the money out of our account.",Yes,"Physical characteristics or personal descriptors.

So, back in XXXX of XXXX, after spending hours on phone and collecting all the documents proving that I didnt get any of the orders, they almost immediately denied the claims and any appeal and then sent me a letter accusing me of falsely opening disputes to get temporary credit.

5960844,2009/8/22,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Other transaction problem,"In 2021 I started an account with BlockFi, who provided interest bearing accounts on cryptocurrencies you deposit with them similar to savings accounts. They provide crypto wallet addresses specifically for the account holder to send the deposits to, and those wallets are maintained by a third party custodian, I believe either XXXX or XXXX are who they use for custodial services. 

Back in XXXX of XXXX, I deposited just short of {$10000.00} worth of the stablecoin XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) over a couple days to my deposit address they provided me for XXXX. At the time however, the deposit page they provided did not specifically say to only deposit the XXXX XXXX version of XXXX  ( XXXX ) to the address given to me. Since it did not specify that, I sent the XXXX XXXX XXXX  version of XXXX  ( XXXX ) which was made to be compatible with XXXX  XXXX wallet addresses. 

My deposits made it to my provided deposit wallet address successfully. I can see the transactions on the XXXX just fine when looking up the wallet address. My nearly {$10000.00} worth of XXXX is still sitting in that address untouched and safe, but since it wasn't sent in XXXX, they refuse to credit it to me and claim that it is lost money that they hold no liability for and can do nothing to recover it. 

That however is not true, and they simply just don't want to help recover it, and say they can't because the wallets belong to their third party custodian who provided them with the addresses they gave to me. Now when I try to contact the custodians about it, they won't even talk to me because I don't actually have an account with them, BlockFi does, yet BlockFi refuses to contact them on my behalf to remedy the situation. 

Fixing this can be done in a matter of a few minutes if they wanted to be cooperative and it can be done in 2 different ways ... the first way would be for BlockFi to ask their custodian maintaining my deposit wallet address, to provide me with the recovery passphrase key, so that I could import that wallet address into a wallet app on my phone like XXXX, so that I can have access to the contents of it and just send that XXXX  back to my wallet I had sent it from. 

The other simple way to fix it would be for the custodian to simply switch the network on the wallet from their app from the XXXX  network to the XXXX network, which can be done in less than minute, so that they can see the XXXX  that is being held by that address which isnt visible while on the XXXX network, and then just send that XXXX  back to the same address which it came from. Recently I even sent some XXXX to that wallet address, which would be needed to pay for the transaction fee to send that XXXX  back to me, just to make it a quick and hassle free process for them to take care of. 

I should point out that there have been multiple other people who have had the same exact problem here with BlockFi that I am having, sending XXXX XXXX  instead of XXXX XXXX and BlockFi was not willing to help them either and claim they hold no blame and did nothing wrong. However if that were true, then they wouldn't have had to later update the deposit address page to start specifying XXXX tokens only, which you can see in the photos I've attached. They changed it because after this happened to multiple people they realized they partially negligent by not being clear on the original page, and they wouldn't have needed to change it if they did no wrong. 

BlockFi pays a third party to provide and maintain these wallet addresses for them, to provide to us.. If part of their agreement dictates they can't be given the recovery keys by the custodian for the wallets to provide me with or can't have the custodian directly provide me with the keys to my deposit wallet address so that I could have access to recover my digital assets instantly, they can at least ask the custodian to simply open the wallet on the XXXX XXXX really quick, so they can see the XXXX in there, and just send it back to the same address it came from, using the XXXX I recently added to more than cover the transaction fee. It isn't some complex and impossible task like they claim.. but they insist on not helping and so for over a year, a large sum of valuable digital assets of mine have been sitting there, not collecting interest, and being held hostage from me which someone would eventually get to just pocket if I were to die or something.",No,,No,

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called XXXX again to dispute the amount that was stated on the account, but I was unable to speak to anyone. I also noticed during that call that I was unable to pay using the automated system because it stated that my account had not been authenticated yet. I left a message for XXXX to return my call. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I missed a call from XXXX because the call only rang once before ending. No voicemail was left. This is odd because XXXX typically leaves a voicemail and they are aware that they can leave a message. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a call from XXXX of the representatives named XXXX XXXX. We spoke for a couple of seconds before the call disconnected. I called her back immediately, but I was informed that she went to lunch. The man that I spoke with offered to help, so I informed him of the situation. He proceeds to tell me that I have a new account number. He also informs me that theres a third web portal where Im supposed to be paying. I inquire as to why I was not notified about this, and he stated that he wasnt sure. I log on to the portal with the new account number, and notice that the total amount that I owe has once again increased to over {$12000.00}. I bring this to the mans attention as this is now XXXX times what I owe, but he is unsure of the reason for the discrepancy. I notify the man that I will try to pay my balance using the new number and the automated phone system because I do not feel comfortable disclosing my bank account information to such a shady company. Even with the new account number, I receive the same message that states that my account can not be authenticated. I speak with a representative who states that she will have XXXX give me a call back once she returns from lunch, but I never receive a call from her. I go online to try to pay on the new portal, and I notice that there are XXXX different accounts all under my name and that XXXX of the accounts are for a XXXX XXXX Account. The third account is for XXXX XXXX. All three of these accounts are incorrect because my car was financed through KIA Motors Finance. At this point, I do not feel comfortable paying into any of the accounts because I can not guarantee that anything is legitimate, especially considering I never received a final bill from KIA Motors Finance. 

After that, I tried calling to speak with XXXX XXXX multiple times, but was never able to get in contact with her until XX/XX/XXXX. She transferred me to her manager, XXXX XXXX. I point out all of the discrepancies that I have been having with my account, but nothing is resolved. Instead, she continues to insist that I pay over the phone or mail in my payment. I also discussed with her the fact that the system doesnt allow me to make a payment in the amount that I typically pay. She is unsure of the reason why and says that she will have her supervisor look into it. To this date, no changes have been made to my account.",No,,No,

XX/XX/XXXX I phoned BoA XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX pm XXXX, to ask about the XX/XX/XXXX email and the security of my account. BoA advised me to treat the XX/XX/XXXX email as fraudulent, to forward the email to XXXX, that BoA had not sent me the email I received on XX/XX/XXXX, at XXXX pm PST. I was further advised that my account was secure. 

This constitutes a major error on BoA 's behalf, as the XX/XX/XXXX email was in fact the legitimate result of the XXXX XXXX, someone other than myself, fraudulently accessing my BoA account and adding a fraudulent transfer account ending in XXXX, routing XXXX to my profile, to which they would fraudulently transfer {$3000.00} via a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX later that same day, XX/XX/XXXX.

U believe under the "" CARES ACT '' they should have removed late payments and went back to reporting it current because of cover .I have been trying to get this matter resolved for about a year now. I have even worked closely with one of the XXXX credit reporting company to resolve the issue but after months of trying to resolve the issue through them, I was told I could only fix the problem through discover card, they could only make a note of the error. The error that I am referring to is Discover card had reported my account late on payment 3 times resulting in my credit score to drop XXXX pts. I have been with Discover for XXXX year and I have been in good standing throughout the duration and I continue to do so even today when they have not fixed the error. I am currently XXXX living In XXXX paying XXXX a month to stay here because my once excellent credit score is to low to get approved for a home. The error accord when back in oct/nov of 2020 this is during the pandemic. I reached out to them to see what pandemic relief programs were available because most of my other credit card had programs. My mother was going through a really bad divorce at the time so I moved in to help her but she was forced to sell the home in the divorce so I was trying to get a jump on all my finances so that's why I reached out. I then consulted with a young lady in which she came up with a program in which my monthly minimum payment would increase from XXXX to XXXX a month and it would keep me current in terms of my payments. Which I agreed to because I she said by doing so I wouldn't be reported late. So I moved into a hotel with my mother for 3 months while we looked for a home. finally found one and was denied do to my credit score. Thats when I realized Discover was reporting my account late even though the program the young lady put me in was taking the amount out of my account monthly through automatic payment. So I didn't realize the dip in my score because to my knowledge the money was coming out of my account. Once I found this out I immediately contacted Discover to rectify the situation. This is prime time in the pandemic most ppl were working from home. So it was difficult to actually get a manger on the phone or find anyone who could resolve this issue. I finally got a manager after weeks of sitting on hold being transferred day by day to get someone who either transferred to someone who couldn't help or just simply hung up. I finally got a manager in which understood what happen then credited my account XXXX dollars do to the error on behalf of the employee who essentially put me in the wrong program which wasn't making my account which was the reason for me calling in the first place. I let several people know about he situation I was in, pleaded with several ppl who simply didn't care and didn't want to fix the reporting side of the issue which was do to the fact there employee was misinformed and then misinformed me. I was told I had to go through credit bureau ( XXXX ) etc to remove the late payments, eventhough the money was automatically coming out of my account every month and is still doing so till this day. I then filed disputes with equfiax which took more months to resolve which finally they said we can make a note of it but Discover is the actual one who has to remove the wrongful late payments.
