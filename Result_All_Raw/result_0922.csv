6024836,09/27/22,Credit card or prepaid card,Fees or interest,"This is a follow-up of Complaint ID XXXX of XX/XX/XXXX, against Banco Popular of Puerto Rico ( the Bank ) forwarded to this entity by the Office of Senator XXXX XXXX. Also forwarded to his office. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, the CFPB closed the case indicating that they werent able to forward it to the company for a response either because the company is not on our complaint system, or because we do not currently handle complaints about this product or issue. 

On a XX/XX/XXXX, call to the CFPB, an agent explained that maybe this was due to a mistake since the Consumer-Identified Company is set as XXXX ( an Airline and the sponsor of the credit card issued by the Bank. ) She could not reopen the case but I could file a new complaint to explain the error. 

Upon login, the list of complaints shows that this complaint was Sent to Regulator FTC Since the start of this case in XXXX, the Federal Reserve Consumer Help has indicated the CFPB to be the entity to file this complaint. 

These two errors show very negligent handling of complaints even when being forwarded by a Senator.

In this new complaint, I add an update to the Banks position, dated XX/XX/XXXX. It was made in response to a request for help to XXXX XXXX. It has a segment dedicated to help consumer problems. Here, as in the response to the first complaint to the CFPB, the Bank upholds its initial position that the annual fee and other charges as well as the bad credit reports were correct and can not be removed. 

Although, the annual fee charge of {$140.00}, plus the interest and fees that raised this amount to {$190.00} may be insignificant, for many it can have a profound effect on their economy. Also, the bad credit reports made by the Bank can have a great effect on most consumers reducing or eliminating their credit worthliness and even affecting their chances to get a better home mortgage or refinance. 

CFPB agents have indicated that it does not have enforcement powers but its website has an Enforcement tab. It shows cases where businesses were ordered to stop their unlawful practices, return all unlawfully charged fees and costs, plus interest, and fine them with millions in penalties. 

I hold that from the first response of the Bank to my CFPB complaint on XX/XX/XXXX, the CFPB has always had the authority and all the evidence it needs to enforce federal consumer financial laws. The Banks position maintained in its XX/XX/XXXX, response, clearly evidences that it will keep on violating federal consumer financial laws as done in my case for over 2 years by refusing to credit an annual fee for the use of a canceled credit card, adding fees and interest on this charge, making derogatory credit reports to credit agencies, and failing to follow dispute procedures. 
Yet, the CFPB continues to evade its duty to enforce federal consumer financial laws by failing to investigate if the Bank violated these laws and, if warranted, take enforcement action against the Bank. 

This case evidences the absolute and repeated failure of the CFPB, to enforce consumer protection laws and the brute inhumane abuse of a bank lawfully charged with having knowledge of the credit card laws but has maintained its unlawful practice with the blessing of the CFPB for over 2 years. Clearly, an investigation of this case could very possibly reveal more unlawful acts of the Bank.

Due to various circumstances, including my wife being diagnosed with XXXX during the pandemic, her XXXX classifying her as a high-risk individual, and events involving my job, we were forced to take a mortgage forbearance. 

Flagstar did what it could to ensure we agreed to pay the forbearance amount up front. While we continually insisted that we wanted to place the amount owed at the end of our loan period with an APR of 0 %, applying to that amount as we were legally allowed to do. 

Tactics like offering to refinance our 30-year conventional with a 40-year meant an opportunity for tens of thousands of dollars of extra interest payments over the life of the loan. Flagstar representatives continually called us, demanding we frequently verify that we didnt move out or intend to sell the property. 

Once we could proceed with resuming monthly payments, Flagstar agreed to move the amount of the forbearance to the end of the loan period. We thought we could finally move on without accruing additional interest on that amount. However, things were not that simple. During the forbearance period, Flagstar demanded a payment of {$2800.00}, which we paid out of desperation. 

The transaction history file Ive included indicates the payment of {$2800.00} was applied to the mortgage principal but subsequently reversed, with Flagstar holding {$1600.00} in suspense. Our monthly mortgage payments increased, and its still unclear whether or not Flagstar is still holding {$1600.00} hostage. 

Now XXXX has reduced two of my credit lines as a reaction to Flagstar reporting the mortgage account as being more than 120 days past due. The reported balance is higher than when we initially obtained the mortgage three years ago. 

Upon looking at a breakdown of what is owed on our monthly statement ( the account is paid online where this information is not present ) Flagstar added the amount of the forbearance as a second mortgage, and it appears that they added that amount to the total owed. As of the last reported date of XXXX XXXX XXXX we have no missed payments but have paid off 0 % of our total loan amount. 

At every point, we have seen the ethical shortcomings of the people who pilot Flagstar. even something as simple as removing the PMI on the property due to its appreciation in value was ignored.

5957755,09/07/22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Incorrect information on your report,"To Whom It May Concern ; I have made numerous attempts to provide Experian, XXXX and XXXX with government documents in the form ( s ) of various XXXX Department Police reports which have included a criminal police report case number XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX where I was identified as victim # XXXX  on page 2 as a person who's identity was stolen and used. I have also provided all 3 CRA 's an identity theft police report case number XXXX, a Financial Crimes police report, number, case XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX and an FTC Identity Theft report number XXXX in regards to criminal fraudulent use of my personal information. 

I have disputed and sent all of the above police and FTC reports on numerous occasions in XXXX & XXXX of XXXX, in XXXX and again in XXXX. Yet, All 3 CRA 's continue to report fraudulent information on credit file which is in total violation as my consumer rights in the state of California. When any of the three CRA 's are asked how they verified the fraudulent information, I'm always told that the creditor verified that the account ( s ) belong to me. 

If any of the 3 CRA 's attempted to verify any of the police/FTC reports provided to them, they would indeed find that my claims are true and that I was in fact contacted by my local police department about several crimes committed by the two individuals that were arrested. 

It is my full belief that all 3 CRA 's are negligent in properly verifying these fraudulent accounts and considering that the creditors in question who continuously furnish fraudulent information to the CRA 's are paying customers, their word over my proof is enough to allow these creditors to continue to damage my credit and cause me harm. 

There is literally nothing left for me to do as a resident of California that is required under the FCRA in my state of residence that would offer me any comfort in trusting the information provided by the 3 CRA 's in protecting my personal and private information. Their continued abuse of my personal credit information is appalling and disgraceful and has caused me irreparable harm. 

Just recently, I have been applying for a new housing rental and have been told that I have to pay twice the amount of a security deposit to secure the rental. That's {$8200.00} USD to pay as a security deposit instead of {$4100.00} that I would qualify for if it weren't for the fraudulent accounts that the 3 CRA 's are allowing to report on my credit file. I have been charged a higher interest fee for buying a car due to their irresponsibility. This is just a snippet of what their actions have caused me for the last 2 years. 

My wife was also a victim of this identity theft ring. As a matter of fact, my entire household was victimized by these two criminals. There were also several other victims named in the XXXX Police Departments Criminal case. My wife was able to get all of the fraudulent accounts removed and blocked from her credit file, while I was made to suffer for something that I had absolutely nothing to do with. Although I provided all three CRA 's with ample information to assist them in their investigations, it quickly became apparent to me that they could all care less about the accurate reporting of my personal credit information. 

The fraudulent accounts included companies such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and their collectors and a multitude of other fraudulent accounts opened at large corporations. I have been damaged over {$80000.00} in the fraudulent opening of accounts. My personal bank account was harmed in this fraud as well as it was literally drained at one point in time and I provided proof to all 3 CRA 's of this fraudulent activity. I am lucky that my local police department was able to catch the thieves and put a stop to their madness by locking them up. However, I can't say the same for any of the 3 CRA 's as they have facilitated the creditors in literally ruining what once was a great credit profile. 

I kindly ask that you make the 3 CRA 's answer for why they have allowed fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit file by not removing or blocking the reported fraud from making its way into my credit file and damaging my good credit. I also kindly ask that you make them take action in removing the reported fraudulent accounts followed by blocking the creditor from ever reporting the fraud to the CRA again. My rights have been cosistently violated by Experian, XXXX and XXXX for the last 2.10 years and it must stop. 

All police/FTC reports are verifiable and there are detectives ready to confirm what happened as is stated in the reports that I have provided to all 3 CRA 's . The accounts that I have been fighting to remove are as follows : XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Account - XXXX or XXXX ( transferred ) No action taken by the company XXXX- {$50000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account - XXXX ( closed ) No action taken by the company Amount- {$8600.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( closed ) No action taken by the company Account - XXXX Amount {$12000.00} Experian and XXXX are by far the worst offenders. XXXX seems to have removed all fraudulent accounts except for the XXXX XXXX  account. Experian is even listing addresses and phone numbers that don't belong to me. 

In closing all I would like to happen is that my credit be restored to the condition it was in prior to the fraudulent activity that I have proven does not belong to me. I have complied with everything asked of me by the creditors and the 3 CRA 's yet I get nothing in return but a fake credit file full of crimes not committed by me. All I ask is that these companies simply comply with my state law along with the FCRA rules and regulations. 

Thank you for your time and understanding. Hopefully together we can put this all behind us and carry on. 

At least the culprits are in jail.

Navient responded to my CFPB complaint by stating it placed this account on a hold due to another lawsuit involving bankruptcy by other plaintiffs. Navient did not include when it placed the account on hold, why there was no notice sent to me about this hold prior to my CFPB complaint. Navient also did not acknowledge that there has been no payment on this account for more than 14 years. Navient stated that the account was not in default and that was a part of the 39-stated settlement. I have not received notices of any kind from Navient ( billing or otherwise ) prior to filing a CFPB complaint in XX/XX/XXXX. In fact, I have not received any monthly bills for over 14 years. I noticed that Navient had put the account in deferment in XXXX, based on my credit report, but I had not received any communication from Navient. Even after Navient responded to my CFPB complaint in XX/XX/XXXX, it had not sent me any billing notices or informed me when the hold from the plaintiffs lawsuit would be lifted. Now, Navient has reported this account 60 days late to the credit bureaus. This is unspeakable financial trauma that Navient has been inflicting on me and my family for over 20 years.

I contacted the school and tried to reach a resolution since I could not continue with the course for medical reasons but was not able to reach an amicable agreement. It should be noted that I was not informed of an income-based repayment program by XXXX XXXX XXXX Navient 's predecessor, and yet the account was placed in a forbearance payment plan. I received a bill months after my daughter was born for {$10000.00} ; Navient took ownership of the account, has not sent me billing notices for over 14 years, continues to report the account to the credit bureau, and now has the account in a 60 late payment status with the credit bureaus. I understand that this company has attorneys at its disposable ; however, consumers have rights, and they should not be disregarded ; there are more consumers than profitable/predatory student loan corporations. I have filed a complaint with the DOJ in New York and California. I understand that this will give Navient a heads up and they may attempt to thwart the history of this account on its books; but I am prepared to obtain legal representation, alert various media contacts, and research others who have been harmed by this particular practice of hiding accounts in deferment to obfuscate the 39-state lawsuit.",Yes,"Categories: 2 and 4.

5955577,09/06/22,Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"Shellpoint has charged a late fee that I feel was wrongly imposed and they stated they are unable to reverse it. Customer service told me they the ability to waive the late fee had I already not made a subsequent payment but because I made the next months payment, the late fee was already applied and they can not credit my account. 

The mortgage payment for XX/XX/XXXX went up by {$83.00}. I never received the notice of the increase payment, although their records show that it was sent to me. Anyhow, I made the XXXX payment ( via my automatic bank pay ) of the old amount. Because there was a deficiency, of {$83.00} Shellpoint imposed a late fee of {$20.00}. 

The late fee notice is dated XX/XX/XXXX but since I was out of town I did not get the notice until XX/XX/XXXX. Since the XXXX payment was now due, I went ahead and made sure to submit a timely sufficient XXXX payment and believing I could contest the late fee after. 

I called Shellpoint after the XXXX payment was received to challenge the imposition of the late fee. The customer service rep explained that he did not have the technical capability to reverse the fee. He informed if I called before I made the XXXX payment he could have waived it. 

First, I believe I should not have been imposed the fee due to not having received notice, and the amount of the deficiency balance. 

Second, the imposition of the full amount of a late fee- {$20.00}- declared owed due to a deficiency of {$83.00} on the account is wrong/disproportionate. The late fee amount is what is supposedly stated in the mortgage note and is the full late fee regardless of what the amount owed. To me this is highly unfair and deceptive. 

Third, the inability of the customer service rep to remedy the situation due to payment and timing is unfair and illogical. 

Fourth, the rep did provide a means to snail mail submit an appeal or to fax, which I may still try to do, but they should have an electronic means to submit such things. Going through the extra steps of write, print and snail mail/fax is burdensome compared to the {$20.00} fee in dispute.",No,

5972618,09/12/22,"Payday loan, title loan, or personal loan",Problem when making payments,"In mid-March I rolled over an old loan into a new loan. I originally asked for only {$1000.00} but the lender I spoke to, or an employee of the lender let me know that in the state of California the smallest personal loan you can take out is {$3000.00}. I'm fairly decent at making large payments or multiple payments monthly to any loans/credit cards I've had. I'm military and was unaware that I'm not supposed to roll over an old loan into a new loan. The loan terms were 54 payments at 35.99 % APR with {$5700.00} as the finance charge ( amount the credit was costing me ). Amount actual financed was {$5500.00}. {$560.00} was rolled into the loan with a {$250.00} prepaid finance charge. 

After a few payments were made I noticed that my principal wasn't going down. In XXXX I went to a XXXX  financial specialist to discuss why I was struggling with paying off the loan. By the end of XXXX I had made the following payments : XXXX XXXX {$300.00} towards the previous loan ( not going to total this in further down ) XXXX XXXX {$560.00} this payment came from the new personal loan I had taken out So in March- I had only made one payment from my checking account towards the loan. Had I not taken the second loan out I'd owe {$560.00} going into XXXX. The new loan rolled the old loan into it. 
XXXX XXXX returned check- this will give me a {$15.00} late fee which is fair XXXX XXXX {$300.00} ( only {$45.00} went towards the principal ) XXXX XXXX {$300.00} ( {$240.00} went towards the principal ) XXXX XXXX {$200.00} ( {$190.00} went towards the principal ) XXXX XXXX {$200.00} ( {$120.00} went towards the principal ) XXXX XXXX {$200.00} ( {$130.00} went towards the principal ) At this point I've paid {$1200.00} towards the loan in a span of 3 months. 20 % of the loan amount. Yet, only {$740.00} 13 % had gone towards the principal. I understand some of the payment portion should go towards the interest. Look at the inconsistency of those payments being sent to principal vs interest. 

Once I saw the inconsistency and the financial specialist looked over the loan they noticed some red flags for Military Lending Act terms. I was referred to a XXXX  representative. He reviewed the loan contract. He noticed immediately that there are two different rates on the contract. I have an APR of 35.99 % and a contract rate of 33.39 % on the second page, and the old loan being rolled into the new loan. 

In addition to the above, let 's rewind back to the {$250.00} prepaid charge I mentioned earlier. The loan meets the XXXX interest rate under the XXXX XXXX XXXX of 35.99 %. When you add that {$250.00} charge in, it's no longer XXXX, it's 37.2 %.

The phantom back office has no direct number, extension, email, fax, social media accounts, and it is only a unilateral communication of certification confirmation. There has been no communication from this department, ever. It claims all taxes have been sent to IRS, thus refuses to refund any funds. If in fact, taxes were submitted to IRS on my behalf, there has been no confirmation or acknowledgment from IRS.

There is something prohibiting the W-9 certification and uploading the form to their system. They refuse to remedy the issue source, and instead demand I repeat the failed methods infinitely.

This all happened in XXXX or XXXX. Then out of no where I get a letter from Wells Fargo in XXXX stating that they messed up and shut my account down for fraud when it wasn't and they made a mistake. They gave me a {$150.00} they said for my funds that were in there and a some to make up for their mess up. Seriously!!! I had more than that in my account and they want to give me less and what like {$50.00} for their mess up. Actually they gave me nothing for their mess up and didn't even give me back all the money I had in my account before they wrongfully closed my account without notice or anything. If I owed them money best believe I would have to pay interest on all that money for as long as it took for me to pay them back. They already put me through a lot of stress and problems by leaving me and my kids without any money and closing my account for no reason. Then they basically slap me in the face with this letter admitting they messed up 7 years later and on top of it not even give me all my money back and say they gave some to make up for their total XXXX up that really left me and my kids in a bad spot!! I would like to sue them. They stole my money and apologized later and gave me back just a little of it. I never deposited the check in hopes of sueing them. I figured if I deposited the check it might be agreeing with the amount they gave me and I might not be able to make them be held accountable for this crime. I still have the letter and the check they sent me. I would like to know what I can do to get all my money plus interest for the XXXX they put me and my kids through for no reason. Its crazy that a bank can just steal anyones money like that and they get away with it. I want something done about it.

To the best of my recollection, I contacted them approximately six times to try to accomplish these : 1 ) Attempted on the phone and was told that I needed to visit a branch to close the checking account. Created a request to close the credit card account and was told it would be processed or I would be contacted 2 ) Visited a branch, where it was confirmed that my initial concerns about Regions bank and its credit card partner were confirmed by the bank manager and I received my funds. 
3 ) Attempted to close credit card with Regions Greenline customer service, as I received another bill 4 ) Attempted to close credit card with Regions Greenline, as I received another bill. Recurring charges accumulated on the card. As I had closed the account, I expected these types of bills to come due from the merchants ( much as if I had canceled a credit card if it was lost or stolen and the number became inactive ), not for Regions to continue operating an account I had asked them to close several times and had been assured would be processed on these phone calls.

The funds being used were from a certified check verified via telephone by XXXX XXXX, Finance Manager for XXXX as I sat at his desk. Once the funds were verified, XXXX XXXX who I was told doesnt work there anymore, began printing out the paperwork to transfer the vehicle into my name and any other paperwork needed for the transfer of my vehicle. Before signing any of the paperwork, I ask XXXX XXXX if they would be running my credit because one of the papers that was placed in front of me looked like a credit application. I asked to make sure that this was a cash purchase and informed XXXX XXXX that I did not want my credit ran, being that being that I was in the process of building credit and shouldnt have my credit ran on what was equal to a cash transaction. XXXX XXXX assured me that there was no need to run my credit because as I heard when he called to verify the fund, that the funds are indeed verified via the earlier call. With that reassurance I signed all the paperwork XXXX XXXX placed in front of me and drove home an hour later in my XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

XXXX I call up to XXXX  XXXX to inquire as to why I still have not received the license plates or title to my vehicle. While on hold I see the consumer credit contract or retail installment sales contract that shows that I financed the vehicle and made one payment for the total amount of the vehicle. I inquire with XXXX the new Finance Manager, as to why they would document a cash transaction as if I financed the vehicle. XXXX informed me ( 7 months after purchasing the vehicle ) that they indeed did run my credit and the reason that the company does that is in case the funds from the check were not available. Again XXXX XXXX called and verified the funds right in front of me so I immediately pointed that out and addressed the violations including identity theft with him before ending the call. XXXX did not have my permission to run my credit at all. XXXX should not have falsely recorded what is equivalent to a cash purchase as a retail installment loan when there was never a loan that XXXX XXXX provided me. 

There was no reason for them to run my credit. There was no reason to open a retail financing contract when the vehicle was paid in full with a verified check. If they did have a company policy to the contrary that was not disclosed to me and should have been as soon as i told the finance manager that i did not want my credit ran.

6034441,09/30/22,Credit card or prepaid card,Problem with a purchase or transfer,"I received a response for Case number : XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX today. Included in the response were my account statements, including my most recent, which I have not received by email, presumably because the criminal party has changed the email address on my BoA profile. I in fact, have not had access to or control of my account since prior to XX/XX/2022, when the criminal party changed the mailing address associated with my account, and requested a new card for my account ( which I have not received ). On the most recent statement there is a fraudulent {$5000.00} direct deposit funds transfer to a fraudulent checking/savings account which I do not own or have access to, on XX/XX/2022 ( reference number : XXXX ). 

I still do no have access to my BoA account. I have not had access to my BoA account since prior to XX/XX/2022. On XX/XX/2022, it came to my attention that my card XXXX was not working. I had been contacted by a vendor the day prior because they could not process my card XXXX. They told me that my address was coming back to them as not associated with my card. The following day, XX/XX/2022, I attempted to login to the visa prepaid BoA site but was unable to. The site continually retuned my login information as "" security information is incorrect. I then phoned BoA card services. Upon reaching the outgoing automated system, I input my card number ending in XXXX. Immediately, I was told that the card XXXX was closed. Once I spoke with a BoA representative, I was unable to be verified, presumably because my security and profile information had been fraudulently changed by the criminal party. I was told that I would need to be verified in person before any additional information about my profile could be shared with me. As I have told BoA card services every single time this has been demanded of me, I told them that I have health concerns and XXXX which preclude me from entering public buildings during a global pandemic. As such, my only option for verification is to defer to my sponsor, The XXXX, which I did the following day XX/XX/2022. Additionally, during our XX/XX/2022 conversation, BoA card services did confirm that a new card had been requested for my account. OF NOTE, I have not received a new card. Meaning, as I suspected since XX/XX/2022, when I was told that my address was not the address associated with my card, the criminal party has changed the address on my BoA profile ( which I have not been able to access since before XX/XX/2022 ), and had a new card for my account ( which you say you just credited ) sent to their address. 

As I have repeatedly demanded, I will require any refund of my stolen money in the from of a check, sent to my correct home address. I have also repeatedly said, this is 100 % necessary because my BoA debit account is clearly not secure. However, I must point out now, that I 100 % do not have control or access to "" my '' account. Any funds placed into that account by BoA, will have likely been stolen by the time anyone reads this response, and before I ever have the chance to access them myself. 

BoA needs to have someone contact me directly by phone at ( XXXX ) XXXX. Ideally, that would be XXXX XXXX from regulatory complaints ( XXXX x XXXX ). Whoever it is, needs to call me and discuss BoA judgements on my claims, before any refund is credited. 

Again, I have not accessed my BoA account or online profile since prior to XX/XX/2022. My BoA card ending in XXXX was closed around XX/XX/2022, when the criminal party fraudulently requested a new card for the account. XXXX XXXX is still the most recent card I have in my possession. I never received the replacement card. The replacement card has presumably been in the criminal party 's possession for several weeks. I have called BoA multiple times for help.

One for {$46.00}, one for {$20.00} and one for {$870.00} ( which when it posted a couple of days later was split into two transactions of {$430.00} ). I let Wells Fargo know that I was out of the country, yet they failed to flag these big transactions as fraud. Yet, while I was abroad I almost got stuck in an airport because they flagged a much smaller transaction as fraud even though I told them I was traveling. I had to pay international calling fees to call WF Bank in order to remove the hold. 

As soon as I saw the fraud when we landed, I called to report it. However, WF noticed that the {$20.00} charge was recurring and that it started back in XX/XX/XXXX. They started the inquiry from XXXX but failed to let me know about the 60 day rule. So they refuse to refund the almost {$900.00} because of XXXX {$20.00} charge back in XXXX for a rule that I was never aware of. 

They told me that the Reg E rule is in all the disclosures when I open up accounts however, I keep finding that the Reg E wasn't a thing until XXXX and I've had my accounts open since I was XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ). 

I also found out the the charges of {$430.00} were made through XXXX online and the people did not use my name when entering the card info. It should have never gone through if the name they used didn't match the name on the card. These transactions should have immediately been flagged because of using the incorrect name and also for the fact that Wells Fargo was aware that I was in XXXX when these transactions occurred. I also should have been made aware of the 60 day liability rule.",Yes,"Basic (names, ages, legal representation).

The minute I read the email I checked my account and called them. There were several transactions to a merchant named XXXX and XXXX. Capital One told me the amount total of these transactions was {$540.00}. I opened a claim with them because these charges weren't mine. They never credited my account of the loss funds and never sent me the reason why. They didn't advise me of anything, only that my claim was denied. Never once have I had transactions with this company, and once stopped, they stopped, or so I thought. No more than a month later, my account was completely drained by a fraudulent XXXX XXXX account. My only alert to this was that my rent check bounced. I've never bounced a check the entire time banking with Capital One. I called them immediately, crying this time, because I felt it was their fault this happened. Now, I've had a XXXX XXXX account prior to this happening, but it was only to deposit to my bank account, never withdraw from my bank. AND my XXXX XXXX was never funded through my bank, only by cash at XXXX and that was three times. I never used it. This fraudulent XXXX XXXX  responsible for draining my account, wasn't mine. Over {$1400.00} was taken this time in over a hundred transactions. While I was on the phone with a Capital One representative, whom ever is responsible for stealing my money, was actively trying to withdrawal money WHILE I WAS ON THE PHONE REPORTING THIS, the representative told me every time they attempted to use my debit card and the amount they were attempting to take out. So, I filed this claim, it took over 10 days for them to put my money back into my account, only to deny it a month later, claiming that they believe I am in receipt of the merchandise bought with the stolen funds. I am absolutely dumbstruck. I can't believe they are doing this to me. I AM THE VICTIM HERE, this isn't right. I am a hard working nurse and a single mother, never once have these types of transactions come out of my account in my banking history, and for them to claim that my transactional history makes them suspect that those were my charges is LUDICRIS. This is not my doing in any way shape or form. The only thing I'm guilty of is not checking my transaction history as often as I should, because this has never happened to me before these two events. When I log in, its to quickly check my balance, that's it. So- I filed a police report, I filed an identity theft report with the FTC , and now I'm filing a complaint here. I will not stop until I am given back the money that was stolen from me. It's bad enough being a victim of identity theft, now I'm victimized by my own bank.

My complaint is how Wells Fargo has handled this whole thing. Within 30 to 45 minutes after I was at my bank authorizing the wire transfer, I realized I had been scammed. I called Wells Fargo Bank Fraud Department and reported what had happened and told them not to send the money -- that it was a scam. At that point in time, they couldn't tell me if the money had been sent. Part of the scam was that the scammer had access to viewing my screen and getting into my bank accounts. He transferred money from one of my accounts to another in order to cover the wire transfer. I did not know he was seeing my online banking and I did not give him authorization to transfer money from one account to another. 

Since then I have contacted W F B XXXX Department several times, have gone into the bank. I have not been given any correct information about when the wire transfer was actually sent ( date and time. ) I'm not sure what you can do, but friends recommended I make a complaint with you.

I filed these claims back on XX/XX/2022 and I got a call yesterday stating to call back in to check the status of them so I did and they said it was filed wrong and it was filed as a dispute and not as fraud and I was telling them that it wasnt my fault they filed it wrong the initial time I called in for this issue I am not one argue about these types of things with the representative I am speaking to because it wasnt their fault technically but this matter was supposed to be taken care of within a time period and it wasnt and they stated I would get a credit if It was! Which still have yet to get any credit to my account. The representative then filed two new claims for fraud on my account and she said it should be done no later than XX/XX/2022 to get the money fully put into my account! Once I got off the phone for this issue thats when I received the email of where my account was being closed on XX/XX/2022 for security reasons and I could not open an account for 12 months with then. I have done literally everything I was advised to make sure my account was secured as far as getting a new card, changing my username, password, getting a new phone and literally doing everything they advised me to do to secure my account and help fraud not happen again but they are going to close my account when Ive done literally nothing wrong whatsoever. Before I had filed these claims my account had never been flagged for anything but after I filed these claims I am getting punished for something that was totally out of my hands. I complied with everything they asked me to do, called in when they asked to do within the timeframe they gave me I have all the claim numbers and departments of where to call to get updates. I am extremely frustrated because they are revoking my access to my account at all now where I can go online and see my balances or claim statuses. No customer should ever be punished for something that was done on their account that was literally out of their hands but the bank is doing it for SECURITY reasons. Ok if thats the case close that account and give me a whole new one and transfer my money over to a new account but no they couldnt do that! I have never dealt with fraud before i even stated that on my calls I made to them so I was praying they would be a bit more sympathetic about it since I am overthinking everything at this point. But no they are punishing me and closing my account its beyond ridiculous! Wells Fargo this last month has been nothing short of a pain in my XXXX.

6029738,09/29/22,Credit card or prepaid card,"Other features, terms, or problems","Hello, I have a XXXX credit card with TD Bank which had over {$2300.00} in fraudulent charges. I reported this fraud over the phone ( several times ) and was told on two occasions and told I would have to wait 90 days to get a response. The employees did not inform me that waiting 90 days for a response would eliminate my protections under federal law as any disputes must be made in writing within 60 days. It has been 27 days since I reported the fraud and I have yet to receive a case number. 

As such, I sent a certified letter disputing the charges, as the pattern of behavior seems to be to delay investigating such charges until I lose my right to be protected under federal law. It has been extremely hard to even contact anyone at the bank due to multiple hour hold times, I have been hung up on several times, and have had no luck getting in touch with someone who can address my concerns or provide me even with a case number. They do not show the charges as disputed in writing online or in any letter, nearly a month after reporting via the telephone. 

I believe that TD Bank is intentionally telling customers to wait 90 days via in order to ensure that a customer loses their federal protections against credit card fraud. This is pattern of behavior I have witnessed among their agents. They do not inform the customer who is calling on the phone that TD Bank has a policy that they do not have to take action on complaints made via telephone, and under federal law the customer has only 60 days after receiving their statement where they can file a written claim. They KNOW that a customer will lose all rights under the law and cardholder agreement to dispute fraudulent charges should the bank not launch an investigation or not find an outcome in their favor. 

Additionally, TD Bank ( and XXXX ) engage in deceptive advertising, saying that customers have "" zero liability '' and that charges are refunded in **five** business days. In the fine print, this five day policy is discretionary. Visa and TD Bank also fail to inform consumers that they lose their protections against fraudulent charges under the law if they do not submit a written claim and only file a claim on the phone. 

I suggest the CFPB investigate these practices, I suspect that TD Bank uses this tactic to avoid their responsiblity to cover fraudulent charges under the law. There is nothing I can do as a single customer, but I have seen other reports of this behavior online. I hope that my complaint spurs some action into forcing more transparency and faster response times for card holders who have been the victim of fraud.",No,

5959124,09/07/22,Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"On XXXX of XXXX, I refinanced my home mortgage with Chase ; I had a 30 years fixed and changed to a 15 years fixed. 
It got approved and I scheduled automatic payments twice a month, on the XXXX and XXXX of each month. I discussed this with the mortgage specialists XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX. 
After a couple of months of payments, I noticed in the mortgage statement that I owed more than what I should. Please note that the statements do not disclose what the different items are about. It's only received by email, and with a final amount to pay. 
I asked them what was that number about since it was way more than what I should be paying and received an explanation in writing that didn't properly explained the problem. ( see email XXXX ) After 2 years, and always paying under automatic payments, I looked for another mortgage broker looking to purchase a new house, and she makes me notice of a debt that I've been accumulating with Chase. 
I called the bank to understand what was it about, and no one could properly explain me the reasons, it escalated until a supervisor noticed that I've been charged with late payments since the first month, since my second scheduled payment was on the XXXX and not the XXXX, which was the deadline to avoid interest charges for late fees. 
I complained about this, since I've never received a notice of late payments, neither a clear disclosure in the statements. It's outrageous. 
The supervisor initially agreed with me and removed the late fees for only 2 months and told me that will escalate this issue for further authorization. It was denied and now, after 2 years, I owe the bank {$3700.00} in late fee charges. 
It's not acceptable under any concept. I'm being charged with a 5 % late fee each month since the beginning of the loan for the whole monthly payment. 
I hope you can help me with this.

Because of covid concerns, I did not eat out for 2 years. Then in 2022 when I tried to use my card, the merchant rejected it. I contacted American Express using the phone number on the back of the card, as well as the number that original number directed me to ( gift card division ). Both told me they have no record of the card. I WAS HOLDING IT IN MY HANDS!!. I went to addresses listed in XXXX to find a local branch in XXXX XXXX AND ALL WERE NON EXISTENT, despite being listed online. Wasted hours trying to find a live person. 

I wrote to corporate headquarters copies of the same detailed complaint to various members of their executive committee. Letters dated XX/XX/2022. One assistant - XXXX XXXX contacted me by email again saying the firm had no record of my card. XXXX  never returned a phone call. 
So I contacted his identified boss, XXXX XXXX, in a second letteer and again restated my case in writing that I had a pre paid card ( expired on its face ) but according to CA and NY law they can't expire. And told him his assistant blew me off by not returning a call to his boilerplate email of we are doing anything. 

American Express never identifies my complaint with an internal code number. So another self serving email by them ( after my second mailed letter ) is sent saying they don't have enough information. Yet with each correspondence sent by me I sent photos of the card, front and back and a photo of my holding it. 
AMERICAN EXPRESS IS STEALING FROM ME. THEY HAVE THE FUNDS FOR PURCHASE OF THE CARD, XXXX WON'T REFUND IT OR PROVIDE A WORKING CARD. Their boilerplate emails say they can't help me because they don't have information. They do. They have the card number ; they have photos.

For the past 18 months I have tried to work with your loan department to re-finance this loan at my present rate. 

As you will see, my revenues that I receive each year are far and away enough to have a refinance accepted. However multiple times I was denied because a large portion of my investments are in companies that strategically tax plan so the 1099s show little or no income ( Even though I am receiving the income ). 

Your loan department rejecting me is ridiculously arbitrary and a failure and caring to look into the actual situation. However, in spite of this, I just figured when the time came, I would sell off equities and pay off the loan. 

Due to the failure and consequences of our administration to manage the economy with any skill, the market has plummeted, and it is impossible to take funds out to pay off the loan at this present time. 

Now, even though I have always had the income to satisfy a re-finance, you want to increase my loan by an absorbent amount. 

THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE XXXX XXXX, What I need you to do ( and what is fair ) is extend the present loan rate another 6 months to a year. Or accept a refinance at the present rate for another 7 years.

All is being investigated by the FTC.",No,
5957781,09/08/22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Incorrect information on your report,"To Whom It May Concern ; I have made numerous attempts to provide XXXX, XXXX and Equifax with government documents in the form ( s ) of various XXXX Department Police reports which have included a criminal police report case number XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX where I was identified as victim # 4 on page 2 as a person who's identity was stolen and used. I have also provided all 3 CRA 's an identity theft police report case number XXXX, a Financial Crimes police report, number, case XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX and an FTC Identity Theft report number XXXX in regards to criminal fraudulent use of my personal information. 

I have disputed and sent all of the above police and FTC reports on numerous occasions in XXXX & XXXX of XXXX, in XXXX and again in XXXX. Yet, All 3 CRA 's continue to report fraudulent information on credit file which is in total violation as my consumer rights in the state of California. When any of the three CRA 's are asked how they verified the fraudulent information, I'm always told that the creditor verified that the account ( s ) belong to me.

If any of the 3 CRA 's attempted to verify any of the police/FTC reports provided to them, they would indeed find that my claims are true and that I was in fact contacted by my local police department about several crimes committed by the two individuals that were arrested.

It is my full belief that all 3 CRA 's are negligent in properly verifying these fraudulent accounts and considering that the creditors in question who continuously furnish fraudulent information to the CRA 's are paying customers, their word over my proof is enough to allow these creditors to continue to damage my credit and cause me harm. 

There is literally nothing left for me to do as a resident of California that is required under the FCRA in my state of residence that would offer me any comfort in trusting the information provided by the XXXX CRA 's in protecting my personal and private information. Their continued abuse of my personal credit information is appalling and disgraceful and has caused me irreparable harm. 

Just recently, I have been applying for a new housing rental and have been told that I have to pay twice the amount of a security deposit to secure the rental. That's {$8200.00} USD to pay as a security deposit instead of {$4100.00} that I would qualify for if it weren't for the fraudulent accounts that the XXXX CRA 's are allowing to report on my credit file. I have been charged a higher interest fee for buying a car due to their irresponsibility. This is just a snippet of what their actions have caused me for the last 2 years. 

My wife was also a victim of this identity theft ring. As a matter of fact, my entire household was victimized by these two criminals. There were also several other victims named in the XXXX Police Departments Criminal case. My wife was able to get all of the fraudulent accounts removed and blocked from her credit file, while I was made to suffer for something that I had absolutely nothing to do with. Although I provided all three CRA 's with ample information to assist them in their investigations, it quickly became apparent to me that they could all care less about the accurate reporting of my personal credit information. 

The fraudulent accounts included companies such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and their collectors and a multitude of other fraudulent accounts opened at large corporations. I have been damaged over {$80000.00} in the fraudulent opening of accounts. My personal bank account was harmed in this fraud as well as it was literally drained at one point in time and I provided proof to all 3 CRA 's of this fraudulent activity. I am lucky that my local police department was able to catch the thieves and put a stop to their madness by locking them up. However, I can't say the same for any of the 3 CRA 's as they have facilitated the creditors in literally ruining what once was a great credit profile.

I kindly ask that you make the 3 CRA 's answer for why they have allowed fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit file by not removing or blocking the reported fraud from making its way into my credit file and damaging my good credit. I also kindly ask that you make them take action in removing the reported fraudulent accounts followed by blocking the creditor from ever reporting the fraud to the CRA again. My rights have been cosistently violated by XXXX, XXXX and Equifax for the last XXXX years and it must stop. 

All police/FTC reports are verifiable and there are detectives ready to confirm what happened as is stated in the reports that I have provided to all 3 CRA 's . The accounts that I have been fighting to remove are as follows : XXXX. XXXX Bank XXXX Account - XXXX or XXXX ( transferred ) No action taken by the company XXXX- {$50000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account - XXXX ( closed ) No action taken by the company XXXX- {$8600.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( closed ) No action taken by the company Account - XXXX Amount {$12000.00} XXXX and XXXX are by far the worst offenders. Equifax seems to have removed all fraudulent accounts except for the XXXX Bank account. XXXX is even listing addresses and phone numbers that don't belong to me. 

In closing all I would like to happen is that my credit be restored to the condition it was in prior to the fraudulent activity that I have proven does not belong to me. I have complied with everything asked of me by the creditors and the XXXX CRA 's yet I get nothing in return but a fake credit file full of crimes not committed by me. All I ask is that these companies simply comply with my state law along with the FCRA rules and regulations. 

Thank you for your time and understanding. Hopefully together we can put this all behind us and carry on. 

At least the culprits are in jail.

I had to provide my last 6 months of bank statements for income verifcation, and I had 14 days to do so. However, i had been using a new checking account the last 4 months, as I closed my old checking account because I was joint account holder with my husband and I had to close it and open new one if I wanted only my name on the bank account. So I could only provide 3 statements from my new account and another 3 I was supposed to get from the bank as it was going to be from a closed account and I had no access to those statements.

I had direct pay set up with XXXX XXXX XXXX  and assumed my mortgage continued to be paid unaware of the sale. 

I had changed my mailing address from the property address to a po box and had mail forwarding in place and had changed my mailing address with XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

Since I did not receive notification of this change in banks I unknowingly did not pay my mortgage for XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, or XXXX of 2022. I accrued {$260.00} in late fees and Roundpoint confirmed they reported me to the Credit Bureau for delinquency of payment.

I paid XXXX XXXX  XXXX XXXX the full amount due of {$8500.00} on XX/XX/2022 to bring my account current.

About 3 months later, I requested the fraud alerts be removed and XXXX and XXXX each took about 5 minutes to complete that task but I have had to call Experian about 15-20 times and their automated system will not let you get to a person account representative. When I reach a business account representative, they advise they cant help. On one call about 2 months back I asked to escalate my issue to a personal account representative or supervisor and was told "" no one was available and I would get a call back '' I requested to wait and they repeated "" no one was available '' at that point I insisted I wait because I wasn't confident I would get a call back and the business representative hung up on me. I also never received a call back from that supervisor. I tried going through the automated system system and it says I do not have a hold on my account but multiple outside parties trying to pull my credit advise differently. I tried to go to the website and I get an error message directing me to call. When I call that number, its the same automated system where you can not get to a representative.

I was unable to claim the rewards from the credit card, so I decided to close it. When I talked with the Chase representative to cancel the card on the phone, she told me that I could get a refund of the annual fee of {$69.00}. Since I had an outstanding balance at that time, she suggested that I could deduct the {$69.00} from the balance and pay the remaining portion of it. I did that, but found out that in a month that the {$69.00} was never refunded to me and it became overdue charge on my account. I called Chase credit card hotline again on XX/XX/XXXX, and the representative told me that the it takes two cycles for the annual fee to be refunded. He suggested that I should get the refund by XX/XX/XXXX. But if I dont get the refund by that time, I should go ahead to pay the {$69.00} to avoid it from being overdue again. I paid the fee in XXXX as I didnt see the refund, and I called Chase XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. The representative told me that hes going to check with their tech team about the conversations I had with the representatives in the past, and send me a response in mail later. However, there was no mention of the conversations in the mail Chase sent me later. 

I went to the Chase office to try to resolve the matter. The representative in the office called the credit card center on my behalf, and asked me to write a letter to explain the whole thing because the card was closed. I wrote the letter and sent it to the Chase representative on XX/XX/XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase credit card center stating that they couldn't refund me the annual fee because the card was closed. 

I was very frustrated with the whole process because two representatives from Chase promised me that I will get the refund of the annual fee, and I had a recording of one of the conversations. However, the story completely changed after I paid the fee in full, and they never sent me any reply regarding the results of their tech teams investigation. Later they even rejected my request for the fee refund on the basis that the card was already closed! The card was closed when the representative promised me that I would get the annual refund. They never answered my request to get those conversations I've had with their representatives as evidence of their promise to refund me back.",No,The redacted complaint does not contain any of the four types of personal information.

I also don't have a phone very often, and when I do, its a XXXX, since you need an address for anything else, and, like I said, I'm homeless. 
Recently, I discovered a XXXX purchase that I didn't make. On XX/XX/22, {$2.00} was deducted from my account. I really doubt that I was there.

Since then, it has been a struggle to pay off this vehicle with a 79 month term with payments of {$470.00} a month. 

I was just made aware of Santandar 's lawsuit that settled a {$550.00} XXXXXXXX XXXX  lawsuit for Predatory lending practices by, in my case states that : The consumer who qualifies for this relief, A ) Defaulted on loan but not repossessed and will be given forgiveness and car title if vehicle was purchased between XX/XX/XXXX thru XX/XX/XXXX. 

In my case, I purchased this vehicle XX/XX/XXXX. Vehicle was repossessed in XXXX. I recovered vehicle and continued to struggle to pay off this vehicle, I am currently in default and at risk of repossession. 

I am in the one of the 34 states included in this lawsuit, California. 

I have contacted Santandar once I learned of the Class Action Lawsuit against them that had accused them of violating Business Code XXXX by using Predatory lending practices, Credit Score Modeling knowing consumers will more likely default on the loan and never be able pay the vehicle off. 

I spoke with several customer service reps, managers and the legal department at Santandar., to find a resolution for my circumstances since I qualify based on the underlying complaint along with my circumstances, they refused to help and demanding past due payments or the risk of repossession. 

I am filing this complaint because I am a consumer and victim of this scandal. 

I qualify for forgiveness of the remaining balance due {$16000.00} and car title along with removing all negative and derogatory points off of the XXXX credit reporting bureau 's. 

Attatched is my contract for this loan with Santandar, my account number listed on all 3 bureau 's and the complaint and settlement information for Santandar Consumer USA. 

If there is any additional information needed, I can provide upon request.

On the Foreclosure sale date I was there at the location where they said the foreclosures auction was going to be and there was absolutely no auction at all in any sense. Even though there was no auction they said there was one and even though it was supposed to be a free competitive auction the VA put a stipulation saying that the loan service can only bid so much, which makes it not a free and competitive auction. So I then contacted the VA to explain that the Foreclosure had gone through and when I informed my VA loan technician XXXX XXXX that it was now time for me to start making payments to them directly like he had explained to me was going to happen they told me that they could have done that but they couldn't get a hold of me so now it's too late even though the auction was just yesterday and it's a done deal sorry there goes your house that you worked the last 15 years almost on and put every XXXX of your XXXX into ( by the way the XXXX comes from combat ).

Then they locked it and then closed it without providing a reason and without giving me a way to transfer my money out before they did that. 

Contacted chase again on XX/XX/2022 to ask why I can't withdraw my money from the ATM, was told by the first representative that it is restricted and going to be re-opened, given a second chance. Then they transferred me to a representative who said he couldn't unlock my online access, I said I need to pay my credit card which is due soon, they said it was not possible, asked to speak to a manager supervisor, manager supervisor put me on hold, told me they couldn't tell me why my account is closed, told me I could not get my XXXX $ from the branch. Representative was very unhelpful and claimed to be a manager/supervisor in the fraud department XXXX however an hour earlier I spoke to a very helpful representative from the fraud department who said my account would be re-opened. This 2nd manager supervisor said that the first agent gave me false information. At this point, I am beyond frustrated and confused as I have two representatives from their fraud department telling me completely conflicting information. The second agent refused to tell me why they are closing my account, I wanted to inquire why as I had not done anything wrong or fraudulent and literally put {$1500.00} of my own money into the account that I need access too. Money which is now restricted/frozen and I am unable to use which I need to survive and pay daily bills/rent/food/credit cards. Absolutely ridiculous. The second agent said they could mail a check which would take 7-10 business days, that is ridiculous in my opinion. If I hold money in a bank, like anyone, I excepted to be able to take it out in case I need it, not for it to be frozen/restricted, and held hostage, with the only way to retrieve it is by unsafe sending measures with USPS and having to wait what could be over two weeks or more with USPS delays along with the risk of having it stolen or lost in the mail. I spent over 90 minutes on the phone with them today, mostly on hold, getting completely conflicting information from different representatives. A few days ago, after I filed my CFPB complaint, an associate from the executive office called me and told me they received the complaint and are reviewing it, and left my his name and extension. I asked the 2nd fraud specialist who claimed they were a supervisor/manager to call them and put them on the line. They put me on hold, and then said that they were unable to answer the phone. After a while, of the fraud specialist manager refusing to answer any of my questions, and refusing to let me access my money, and take it out of the bank, if the account was so called closed ( as they claimed ) / ( However the first specialist said they were re-opening it. I was getting extremely frustrated and angry. Imagine if you had {$1500.00} budgeted for the week from your work paycheck, and suddenly someone takes it away and practically steals it from you, keeps it hostage. This should not be legal. If a customer has overdraft, or issues with their bank, a returned check, or they fall below balance, or they are late on credit card payments, they are assessed heavy fees by multimillion dollar banks against hard working low income people. However if the reverse is true, the banks are not held accountable at all, they can steal someone's {$1500.00} paycheck after they open an account with the bank, and restrict access to someone's money without providing a sufficient reason as to why. Why are they not assessed fines and penalties for doing that to consumers? Vice-Versa a consumer is assessed penalties for the simplest of actions, such as falling below a minimum balance. After the call, I attempted to call the executive office contact myself, however it was late in the day and I reached their voicemail. 

I called the executive office line and spoke to a nice representative who listened to me and understood my case and seemed to have sympathy for my concerns, he said he would relay the information to the contact who is handling the case, the initial XXXX representative who contacted me, and gave me a case number. I will try to reach the XXXX representative again tomorrow with my case number in hopes of getting some more information/resolving the issue, however having a full time job during the day and morning, this is an extremely frustrating and stressful situation to have to be spending so much of my time on. Ideally I would like to sort out why the fraud department wants to close my account and our thinks something with it is fraudulent when there is no actual fraudulent activity at all. Is it not a legal requirement to provide such information to a banking consumer whose money is being restricted access to? How can someone purse legal action over this. Ideally, it would be great if what the first representative mentioned, that they would re-open the account, as what he referred to as a second chance. However, I'm not entirely aware of the why I need a second chance in the first place. I really hope someone at the CFPB or FDIC can help me.

I do not have a mortgage with Chase Mortgage and have never had a mortgage with Chase Mortgage. 
First, I called to verify that the email was from Chase and not Spam or Phishing. It was confirmed that the email address was from Chase.

I asked if the mortgage information can be looked up by the email address and reviewed by Chase customer service - without giving me any information about the loan to confirm that my personal email is associated with an account that does not belong to me.

I was told because I personally can not confirm the loan information- they are unable to confirm any information. So, I explained based on Chases way of protecting a persons information, if the loan has been with Chase and it would be reasonable to believe - the person with a home loan with Chase would not add another random persons email to their personal loan to receive notifications - then the only way a random email address could have been added is an internal error on the part of Chase. So, Im my case- I called Chase customer service and asked - how can I eliminate my email address from Chases notification system- so that I am not receiving any notifications from someone else personal loan.

Again, I was told my personal email address could not be removed because I can not personally provide the security information on the loan that has my personal email address.

So we ended our conversation with the customer service agent only apologizing nothing can be done. So this seem unfair to both the party that has a loan with Chase and me because Chase made an error.

I understand there is information regarding these leads being sold by the major credit reporting agencies and somehow making it legal to do so. 
I also believe there is an underline issue with this. Not just the fact that there isnt a single person whom I have spoken with who knows this is happening but also the fact that no consumer who has pulled credit for a mortgage has opt in to receive solicitation much less have there personal information sold to a number of mortgage brokers or lenders. 

I am a mortgage broker and I receive phone calls from clients asking me why they are getting between 10 and 15 calls per day, multiple times per day from other mortgage lenders trying to solicit business. Some claiming to be a partner of Transunion and just doing a follow up to make sure the client gets good service. I have an actual recording from a call. 

Do I tell my clients that there information is sold the minute they pull there own credit for a mortgage. it seems that if I am aware this happens then it makes me responsible to disclose the fact that this can happen and more than likely will happen but theres nothing I can do about it. Since the three major credit reporting agencies dont actually pull credit for consumers, they dont have any sort of permission to sell peoples information for profit.

I received another call from a client this morning who stated he received 13 calls this morning from mortgage brokers or direct lenders, all from spam numbers ( robo dialers ). Coincidently I pulled his credit yesterday utilizing rocket pro ( rocket mortgage ) online credit pulling service. Now rocket doesn't sell information, I don't sell information but we both know the credit reporting agencies will sell it. So who is responsible for informing the client that by initiating a credit pull with us for a legitimate service there information will be sold to multiple people. 

This doesn't sit right with me, regardless of being legal or not it seems there should be some protection in the California privacy laws prohibiting this from happening to unsuspecting consumers.

We were on a forbearance plan with Carrington until we signed loan modification documents at the end of XX/XX/2021. After the documents were signed and notarized we were given a new payment amount and terms and started making the new payments through the website. 

The website showed the new terms and payment amounts. We paid XXXX, XXXX and when logging in to pay the XXXX payment the website said there is a problem with this loan. 

I contacted carrington mortgage company and after much research I was informed at that time that the loan modification had failed in quality control. This was the first time we were given this information. After many phone calls and going through multiple channels it was determined that the we needed to reapply for the modification which we moved forward with and submitted the application. 

That process took almost 3 months. During these months I spoke with carrington on multiple occasions, I was advised in those calls not to pay the mortgage payment as it would just be applied to the balance ( which would be rolled into the modification ) In the meantime we were able to go another Avenue and pay off our balance and get current. 

We are now on track but our credit was negatively affected due to missed payments but I feel our loan should never have been taken out of forbearance if the loan modification was not complete. I think there was a breakdown in communication. 

Could you please look into this and see if we are able to get those late payments removed from our credit report?

The representative placed me on hold to investigate then he came back on the line to explain to me that he could see the transaction.

2. Recently PayPal refused to issue a refund even after I had provided sufficient evidence that I had not received an item I had ordered- receipts, shipping claims and dispute documents were filed, and the PayPal staff refused to issue the refund until I contacted the CFPB office. 

The latest issue is that I Notified PayPal of fraudulent access to my account and requested details of who had accessed my account and PayPal Refused to explain and Refused to Investigate the matter.

On Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX, I called Edfinancial to send in a request for a refund of the {$4400.00}. While the request was sent, I am uneasy about the lack of transparency coming from the provider. 

When I asked my customer service representative what the expected processing times would be for this transaction, they could provide me no information.

This situation is frustrating as most of my concerns lie on how long it will take to get my loan balance of {$4400.00} reinstated on my Edfinancial account. I understand the process of actually getting the refund deposited into my account will take a while, but processing the balance reinstatement has been timely with other loan providers. 

Edfinancial has recently had a massive data breach in which my personal information was leaked. They have also been fined for providing misinformation about the student loan cancellation a few months ago, and now they are being vague with the information they are providing to us. All this doesn't help but make me feel uneasy about their unknown processing times for loan balance reinstatement.

I have capital one credit card ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) I filed the dispute the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. I disputed amount of {$60.00} ( dispute case number XXXX ) I called capital on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) I talked XXXX ( ID XXXX XXXX ) on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX said I uploaded requested documents regarding this dispute on XX/XX/XXXX and capital one contacted store on XXXX and store have XXXX to answer so if store does not answer until XX/XX/XXXX I will get {$60.00} credit back. And at this moment store did not repond yet. 
I called again to talk manager to make sure XXXX ( ID XXXX XXXX ) story because when I called on XX/XX/XXXX capital one said it is out of time frame and the case is closed. 
So to make sure XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) story, I talked the manager at capital one again after I finished the conversation with XXXX. 
I called again on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX and I talked XXXX who is highest level of manager who said. ( ID number XXXX ) XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager said, capital one sent the denial letter on XX/XX/XXXX and requested me the proof regarding the dispute and I must provide the document within 30days which is XX/XX/XXXX and I uploanded proof document on XX/XX/XXXX so this is out of time frame and the case is closed and they can not investigate anymore. 
As XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manageXXXX said. I have letter dated XX/XX/XXXX with me. 
The letter said I need to provided proof by XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX anyway it is not matter. 
Capital one send the letter to my previous home address ( it was sent to XXXX XXXX, I am current live in la XXXX ) capital one letter was forwarded to my new address and I received this letter around XXXX. So I called capital one and capital one said I can upload the docoument online and capital one sent to me the link via email. This link capital one sent to me is valid only 14 days so I must upload within 14days otherwise the link will be expire ( the email from capital one said the link is valid only 14days so if the link expire contact the capital one so capital one can sent me again ) Of course I uploaded document within 14days before it expire. I provide very clear and good proof. 
Even capital one representative on XX/XX/XXXX she said that I provide good proof but it is out of time frame capital one can not do anything regarding this dispute. 
XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager insisted that this dispute is out of time frame because I did not provide the documents until XX/XX/XXXX so the case need to be closed. 
I think XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager argument is not make sense at all. Capital one sent me email link to me to provide the documents and I provide documents within 14 days as it required XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager strongly and repeatly insisted that this disputed is out of time frame because I did not answer until XX/XX/XXXX but how can it can be out of time frame when I provide the proof to capital one email link within XXXX which the link require to answer. 
XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager, she does not seems to solve the problems. She just repeatly and continuously said it is out of time frame. 
1. My point is how can be XXXX. XXXX providing documents to capital one making the case out of time frame? It is totally wrong. I do not know every banking rule however It was XX/XX/XXXX transaction. As common senese, in normal situation, I think I can even start new claim on XX/XX/XXXX which is less than 3 months old. I do not think it is make sense deny my dispute as out of time frame when I upload documents on XXXX XXXX as capital one email link required to me. 
2. My second point is XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager insisted that it is out of time frame but capital one never advised me or warn me valid period of time frame to avoid permantly case closing before it is closed. 
Even though XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager said on XX/XX/XXXX it is out of time frame because I did not reply until XX/XX/XXXX, capital one never warn me that time frame period for permantly closing before capital one denied the dispute ( capital one should NOTIFY me that my case will be permanently closed that if I do not answer until XX/XX/XXXX ) 3. My third point is when I talked with XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) manager regarding time frame she said not only out of time frame but I provide insufficient evidence on XX/XX/XXXX When I talk customer service on XX/XX/XXXX even capital one representiative agreed that I provide good proof regarding this dispute but she said it out of time frame. 
After I talked to XXXX ( ID number XXXX ) XXXX today I went to capital one website and I found out there is letter from capital one dated on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I saw this letter for the first time. XXXX letter did not mentioned the time frame. 
It said it lacks all of the previously requested information need to validate your dispute I provided good enough documents proof this dispute as capitone representative also agreed on XX/XX/XXXX. And if I did not provide enough documents why capital one letter never mentioned the which documents is missing? 
even though I provided good enough documents to capital one if capital one feel it is not enough to decide this dispute why capital one never asked me additional documents to provide? 

I provided good enough documents to capital one but capital one never indicted which document is missing nor requested me provide missing documents to contintue investigate. 
I must feel Capital one do not have real intent to solve this dispute by this capital ones this kind of behavior. 


I got two letters from capital one dated on XXXX and dated on XXXX ( I just confrimed this letter after I talked XXXX ( ID number XXXX ). 

XX/XX/XXXX when capital one sent me the first letter to me, at that moment capital one already took credit from my account and they asked me provide documents. XXXX, capital one did not close dispute and took credit because I did not provide the documents. Capital one request me proof while they are already taking credit from account.on XX/XX/XXXX I truly believe The way catipal one handing dispute is very far away from fairness or rightness and it is also out of common sense. I hope capital one stop doing unfairness for handing the dispute. 

I truly believe capitalone doing wrong without any doubt from my bottom of heart so decided to file this claim Thank you.",Yes,"Category 1 (Basic).

Worse yet, I was told clearly by CIT Bank 's different agents that their review would be done within 24 hours, 48 hours, or 10 business days, respectively -- so, each time when I called, I was told a different story/lie. From the latest call, I was told to wait for 90 days -- that's absolutely a joke, absurd, and ridiculous! The fact of the matter is -- from the calls, I, being an XXXX, feel being discriminated by CIT bank. 

Until now, I haven't received a single phone call or email from CIT Bank -- for almost an entire month ( 21 business days have passed )!

6025212,09/27/22,Mortgage,Closing on a mortgage,"I have been in a nightmare situation doing a refinance with Chase Mortgage Bank. If you are a small business owner I advise you to read this because the deck is stacked against you. 

I started the refinance process XX/XX/XXXX. I originally was working with a lender named XXXX XXXX XXXX. On XX/XX/XXXX I asked my business banking connect at Chase to introduce me to some one in the refinance division as I do all my personal and business banking through Chase. The process started as one would expect, I told Chase I was working with another company and provided them with the disclosure information related to the rate that was locked with the other company XXXX XXXX at par ( no point or additional fees ). 

My lending advisor at Chase was able to submit a request to match the rate that was approved and so Chase begun the application process. The advisor ensured me this would be a swift process given Chase has a very large underwriting team and we were working with the specialty department. 

The process was no such thing, it was painful and long and atrocious. XXXX was constantly requesting documents that didn't exist, incorrectly calculating DTI and Income and numerous other issues. I provide all documentation and answer to request within XXXXhrs of request from XXXX. XXXX would take XXXX business days to respond. Towards the end of XXXX beginning of XXXX I made the decision to cancel the XXXX  Loan and move forward with Chase as I was being told Chase was close to moving to the conditional approval. 

I paid for an appraisal with XXXX in the beginning of the process and had the home appraised around XX/XX/XXXX. The appraisal came in at ~ XXXX XXXXmln. That appraisal was given to Chase and my lending advisor informed me we would be able to receive an exception for the appraisal. Around this same time I received a call from a Chase appraiser requesting to set up an appointment which I did not do because I informed them we had already submitted the appraisal and received a wavier/exception. Again this was early XXXX. This is a key part and will come back to hurt my family and I down the road. 

After closing the loan with XXXX to clear a condition for Chase the nightmare continued. We went back and forth with underwriting for another full month. Again my wife an I providing all information required within XXXXhrs and XXXX  taking XXXX business days to review the file and for us to receive a response. 

At this point I was doing everything in my power to try and figure out how this was taking so long and why the XXXX department was so clueless about what documents, taxes, calculations they were making and why they were requesting things that didn't make sense or even exist. I had no transparency or communication from XXXX other then my lending advisor through this process. Things they were requesting that didn't exist, XXXX XXXX transcripts showing no filing has happened yet for XXXX even though they had the extension paper work. In correct usage of XXXX taxes, i.e. requesting a tax filing for an XXXX, which they had because the XXXX flows to my personal return and was filed in a schedule C. Truly just the most insane things from a department that should know how these things work and why they want them. 

Seemingly toward the end of XXXX, the exact date was XX/XX/XXXX, we had just cleared all/most of the conditional approval items and we were looking good for Clear to Close. I receive a call from my lending advisor stating the exception/wavier for the appraisal was never approved. My XXXX and I were in disbelief and distraught to say the least. It had been XXXX months and the market was rapidly declining. Chase forced us to do another appraisal and we scheduled as soon as we could for the next week with a rush order. Sure enough the Chase lead appraisal came back roughly {$300000.00} less than the appraisal XXXX months ago. This greatly impacted the XXXX and terms of the loan. Reducing our debt consolidation and cash back. We took it on the chin and continued to move forward with the adjusted loan amounts, because there's nothing we can do, if an appraiser things the market as move that much in XXXX months that's there prerogative. 

At this point the rate had expired and been relocked multiple times and we had no clue what was happening with the loan or cost or cash to close. This is an important point that will come back to hurt us in the end. 

The very next week we ran into another issue. The XXXX team so a credit card flex loan on a XXXX statement from early XXXX. Which they already should have known about and was being calculated in our DTI because it was on the credit report. The XXXX team decided to deduct that full loan amount from our reserve requirement putting us under the reserve threshold. Again I was in disbelief because this loan DIDN'T EVEN EXIST. Yes, correct it had been fully paid off and documentation was provided to XXXX showing the pay-off and they chose to continue to deduct it. Tell me, how is that mitigating there risk? This requirement is in place to protect lenders in the event there was a default or bankruptcy and the borrower had to pay back the loan. But that wouldn't matter in my case BECAUSE THE LOAN WAS CLOSED. 

At this point I am ready to throw in the flag. I didn't know what to do, I was calling every manager number and Chase Hotline I could find. No one could help it was always directed back to the lending advisor and everyone answered based on scripts and checkboxes for what they could say and do. No one at Chase cared. I was just another number to them, but yet they are the one losing money for the rate locks and all the time being exerted into this loan in an unnecessary manner. My only option was to look outside of the bank. I turned to the CFPB for questions and help, they directed me to the OCC ( Office of Comptroller of the Currency ) and the Attorney General of XXXX ( home 's state ). I couldn't help to think at this point there was someone in XXXX who wasn't this loan dead or is discriminating against myself or my wife. I use to work at a large publicly traded bank. CFPB informed me to file a complaint but when I learned about the process I couldn't believe that the complaints go directly back to Chase, literally the bank that is causing the issues gets the complaint and power over my situation. is there no government agencies in place to protect little retail consumers like my self? 

I turned to private litigation, looking for an attorney who specializes in Mortgage discrimination and wrong doings. Nearly impossible to find anyone and very expense. I spoke to XXXX  attorneys and either course of action would be more months of suffering and no solution to my lending issue. 

We continued to press on and figure out a way to get our reserve amounts up. I had to reverse three credit card payments to Chase cards to get the reserve amount above this new threshold. At this point my family is suffering financially. I can't move any of my money between accounts for three months. I couldn't pay debts that they would accept and I couldn't pay credit card bills because they were disallowing so much of my funds and only counting funding in Chase accounts mainly. I was hit with late fees and penalties because of this. I couldn't believe a company could get away with this level of negligence and absurdity when it is hurting retail customers financially. No one could help I was stuck waiting through the process. 

After hitting the reserve requirement, of course more conditions popped up to which we responded and met within XXXXhrs of request, to which XXXX  took XXXX days to respond and review. Finally, today, the day I am writing this we were marked clear to close and ready to schedule. 

When I reviewed the final loan terms. I noticed chase had included a {$12000.00} fee in "" points '' on the loan. I was outraged. I immediately contact my advisor who incorrectly informed me this was due to multiple rate locks and a fee associated to it. I couldn't believe Chase had the audacity to charge me for the duration of this refinance when it was all on them and emails, calls, documentation will support that. Of course I immediately called the escalation team to look into it. There was nothing they could do and informed me they have to contact my lending advisor. 

My lending advisor called me back and informed me that the fee was actually due to the new appraisal amount. He said that because the appraisal came back so far below the estimate we used- which mind you the estimate we used was the appraisal I had done in the beginning of XXXX that they chose to not use after XXXX months have passed. That there would be this additional fee on top of the loan. 

So I write this today with no resolution and now stuck with a decision to move forward with this loan that was nothing what it should have been if the process was handled correctly by Chase. I don't know what to do and quite frankly, I don't want the loan with these unbelievable, ridiculous fee that Chase is tacking on. I still can't believe this is all legal and no regulators would want to look into this. 

I have until XX/XX/XXXX to make a decision. Everything in this story can be validated with emails, record phone calls, and any other evidence needed. I hope for small business owners reading this you make a better choice in a lending partner than I did.",Yes,"Category: 2. Physical characteristics or personal descriptors

Some claiming to be a partner of XXXX and just doing a follow up to make sure the client gets good service. I have an actual recording from a call. 

Do I tell my clients that there information is sold the minute they pull there own credit for a mortgage. it seems that if I am aware this happens then it makes me responsible to disclose the fact that this can happen and more than likely will happen but theres nothing I can do about it. Since the three major credit reporting agencies dont actually pull credit for consumers, they dont have any sort of permission to sell peoples information for profit. 

I received another call from a client this morning who stated he received 13 calls this morning from mortgage brokers or direct lenders, all from spam numbers ( robo dialers ). Coincidently I pulled his credit yesterday utilizing XXXX pro ( XXXX  mortgage ) online credit pulling service. Now XXXX doesn't sell information, I don't sell information but we both know the credit reporting agencies will sell it. So who is responsible for informing the client that by initiating a credit pull with us for a legitimate service there information will be sold to multiple people. 

This doesn't sit right with me, regardless of being legal or not it seems there should be some protection in the California privacy laws prohibiting this from happening to unsuspecting consumers. 

Last, I have asked every client I know, every friend I have and non of them understood that there information was actually being sold by the credit agencies, they thought they may have filled out an online form somewhere down the road that opened them up to solicitation but certainly not by a trusted credit reporting agency.",No,

I am currently in the process of attempting to build up my credit score, a number of years after an unanticipated medically related issue led to my filing for bankruptcy relief, as I felt I had no other options at the time. It's been a while since that debt was thankfully discharged, and in the proceeding years I have not made attempts to obtain credit in any form. As a newly married man, I am now endeavoring to rebuild this "" score '' that is unfortunately so vital and incorporated into our identities, and like many of us I want to do whatever I can to provide for my growing family, with the inital goal being homeownership. 

After soliciting advice from multiple sources, I began applying for various lines of credit that I could confidently maintain monthly payments for to keep in good standing, hoping to help increase my lending viability, and offset the stain of bankruptcy still publicly present for another few years. Aside from that unfortunate chapter in my life, I have many fully-paid off accounts with years of unmissed payments including student loans, auto financing, and a number of credit cards. By design though, much of those positive qualities are not visable to potential lenders, and though I have XXXX debts, the lack of any real credit in the past few years is hugely determinitive in qualifying for new accounts. We trust all of our personal data to private companies, that possess immense power and influence over the ability to obtain new accounts, get hired, apply for loans, etc ... With that influence there's an expectation that the information they share to a multitude of parties is both accurate and current, as well as having the ability to remedy errors that are solely the result of their own inadequacies. Adding to that, there's also the expectation that they actually perform the specific actions that they themeselves clearly denote in written Dispute Resolutions as a right of the consumer to request. Concluding on my lengthly rant, here are my specific concerns and motive for filing this report. 

While recently applying for new accounts as mentioned above, I kept getting denials that listed the decision was based on "" inabiliy to confirm identity '', and each one of those kickbacks listed TransUnion as the source of their inquiry. When I was finally able to gain access to the information they had linked to me, it was clear that no updates or changes had been made in many years. Both my place of residence and employer were accurate ot one point time, almost 10 years ago, but no other information in the proceeding years could be found anywhere. It became clear that the info I was providing to potential lenders wasn't matching the "" official '' details given by Transunion- so as a result, I received both hard inquiries to an inaccurate report that will remain in place for 2 years and continue to negatively influence future business, and denials based on unmatching personal information. 

I calmly went through the motions to file disputes and ensure updated details would be visable to 3rd party inquirers, and everything went relatively smoothly at first. You are able to write a "" personal message '' that viewers can see - a sort of "" explanation '' of certain details in your own file, or even just an opportunity to write whatever you feel would be helpful. I completed this step successfully, and all seemed okay. That portion of my "" dispute '' was handled effieciently and without error, and I was provided with a "" Dispute Resolution Summary '' regarding the case. Under the heading "" How to Read your Investiation Results, the very last paragraph states the following verbatim : "" If there has been change to your credit report as a result of our investigation, or if you have added a statement to your report, you may ask TransUnion to send an updated credit report to those who have received your report within the last 2 years for employment purposes or within the last 6 months for any othe purpose '' I can't change text formats here, but the second part of that comment is even presented in BOLD font. Since I did in fact add a statement to my report, as well as have my score take a small hit from the multiple hard inquiries, I was more than qualified to pursue this request... especially with a couple 3rd party applications still open and pending approval. I wanted them ( and everyone else ) to have access to accurate and updated info, or be aware of the changes being made, but the couple hours I spent today speaking with 2 separate reps completely contradicted the promise so clear and misinterpretable in the report summary. 

I spoke with representatives "" XXXX '' and "" XXXX '' - both stated they could/would only send report copies to me individually, and had XXXX additional options or advice other than "" then you can take it to the lenders yourselves ''. I tried to get someone on the phone who could actually explain the grossly negligent difference in what I was looking at in the official document vs what I was being told by the reps, but neither had a single beneficial contribution to me, nor a coherent respose to why the blatant differences existed. I asked to speak to higher-ups or anyone who could actually assist, but was denied. 

I don't think I have to explain that getting an amended/updated report directly from TransUnion would have a significantly greater impact on lenders vs one provided by an individual who was just declined services. Plus, I was hoping that this would influence the currently open applications, who I know from my records obtained copies of my report prior to any alterations that are still in motion. 

If desired, I can provide proof of these Dispute Resolution Results which I possess a few of and all state the same, as well as Adverse Action summaries from lenders where it's stated that the reason for denial was their inability to verify my ID, each listing TransUnion as the source of their inquiries. 

Thank you for taking the time to read ( I hope.. ) the novel of a dispute I just composed, and please reach out to me anytime if you have additional questions/concerns or require copies of aforementioned documents. 

I'm frustratingly out of ideas for how to proceed, and livid over the fact that TransUnion has done nothing but provide false personal info to 3rd parties, and produce additional negative hits with no net benefit during a time when I am trying to do the complete opposite. 

Thank you again for your attention and consideration of my complaint.",Yes,"It belongs to category 2. The complaint states the complainant is a ""newly married man"" and has a ""growing family,"" which are personal descriptors."

6007166,09/23/22,Credit card or prepaid card,"Other features, terms, or problems","Amex is engaged in similar fraudulent activity as XXXX XXXX and someone needs to investigate their business practices. I am an Amex XXXX Card holder. In their card agreement, Amex auto activates a product which acts as a high interest loan to all new accounts. Amex doesn't allow the customer the ability to opt-out of this product at the time of signing up for the card. I signed up for my card in XX/XX/2022 and became aware of this product in XX/XX/2022. I contact Amex to de-activate this product in XX/XX/2022 on a recorded line, which they did. On XX/XX/2022 Amex auto-activated the loan with a 26 % interest rate on my card without my consent. I didn't become aware of this again until XX/XX/2022. Compounding this, Amex auto-populates transactions into their loan product in an attempt to collect 26 % interest on transactions the customer never intended to use for credit purposes. To fix this, it takes Amex days to untangle these auto-populated transactions and de-activate this feature on the card, all of which requires the customer to bring this to their attention and chase in order for it to be completed. Amex is not proactively resolving this without customer initiation. This product is called Pay-Over-Time which holds a specific credit limit. Amex has a separate product called XXXX which shares the same credit limit as their Pay-Over-Time. On XX/XX/2022 I created a loan for on transaction using PlanIt. Amex 's underwriting and back office doesn't process and activate that loan until 30 days after the loan was initiated, in this case the loan was in effect until XX/XX/2022. On XX/XX/2022 I overpaid my Amex card and Amex automatically took my overpayment and paid off this XXXX loan in it's entirety. However they failed to update their system to show this loan was paid instead it's remained in a paid status until now. I'm unclear if Amex reports all their loans to the XXXX credit bureaus but I assume they do which would be a violation of the FCRA. In both circumstances I have brought this to Amex attention and it has taken them days to fix. They make excuses and constantly extend the communicated timeline for each product when it will be fixed. One day it's 24-48 hours, the next time it's 7-10 days. The next time it's 30 days. As of to date, Amex has not fixed either of this on my account. It's still in "" work in progress status ''. Even if Amex resolves this, neither of these scenarios should have occurred. Amex does not have the right to force a product on a customer when they've actively and successfully de-activated the product. They also have a responsibility to post payments correctly and within standard IRS and Account Laws, which they have failed to do for my XXXX loan. Per Amex, this is "" their '' process and a "" standard working practice '' in both circumstances. Therefore I do not feel I'm the only customer impacted by this.

During this whole time ( 3 hours ), the scammer hung up on me after I sent out the first two codes, and called me back using a different phone number : ( XXXX ) XXXX, and kept on reassuring me that the XXXX XXXX was not a real person, but just a dummy account created by XXXX, which couldnt receive any money even if I wanted to send money to it, and the digit I sent out was simply verification codes in the process. The scammer even provided me with his supposedly personal employee information : XXXX, XXXX XXXX to reassure me and gain my trust to keep follow the steps. He even transferred my call to his supervisor because I broke down many times throughout the process, and was crying out loud on the phone for the feelings of being scammed. But, with the trust that it was a real employee, I tried to put faith in humanity and followed the steps trusting their words that my money would appear back because the transactions were pending, and that after I finished the next step, all money would be back on my account.

6034077,09/29/22,Credit card or prepaid card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,"I was forced to pay a nearly {$5000.00} repair bill for items that were never installed and labor that was never approved. An initial invoice was submitted as a final bill, even though the truck was not delivered at that time and there are records that I was still working with the owner to resolve the discovered issues found during the test drive and repeated attempts to pick up the truck after being told issues were resolved. There are records showing the submitted invoice was NOT for a final resolution. There are weeks worth of more back and forth in an attempt to resolve the issues, and admittance by the owner that parts described and billed for were NOT what was installed. Finally, in an attempt to provide more evidence and also verify a dangerous condition with the operation of the vehicle, I had a third party inspect the work. The third party affirmed that what little work was completed was done INCORRECTLY and DANGEROUSLY in a grossly negligent manoralso confirmed directly by the merchant. 

Initially, the owner of XXXX XXXX XXXX and I discussed a {$1500.00} {$2000.00} estimate for the brake upgrade ( including labor ). That estimate rose to {$2000.00} {$2500.00} based on upgrading the size and quality of the brakes ( larger, safer brakes for all tires ). Seeing the part numbers ( which were not disclosed at the time of payment ), it is clear that there was no upgrade. The price also ballooned dramatically from the original estimate to over {$3000.00}. Again, this is without any upgraded parts from the initial {$1500.00} {$2000.00} estimate. Also, the work was contracted out to a third party without being disclosed. I came to XXXX 's XXXX based on history and knowledge of past work. It would have been easier ( and more affordable ) to find someone on my own instead of being charged triple markup on parts and labor. See the attached Invoice for the brake parts highlighted in yellow. The {$1500.00} part is never found for more than {$800.00} anywhere ( see Brake 1 '' ), and the {$770.00} part is only {$55.00} ( see Brake 2 ) and thats if you dont get it included with the first disc brake set which is pretty common! 

Work was also done without my approval. I asked for oil leaks to be remedied. This effort turned from "" a gasket or something '' to over {$1200.00} of additional charges. I was told the work was completed and never asked if I approved the proposed solution or price. Ive highlighted any non-approved work in red on the Invoice evidence. 

Finally, a diagnostic on the speedometer turned into an additional over {$400.00} charge. The worst part was when I tried to pick up the vehicle after over ten weeks of you having it ; it was not safe. The brakes pedal spring damaged and wrapped around the pedal instead of attaching to it! See the attached evidence Repair 1. The truck was too dangerous to drive and in worse shape than when first delivered. Worse than that, when I was paying for the vehicle, I was told the speedometer was "" like it rolled off the showroom floor. '' In the time they had the vehicle to make the brake repair, the speedometer had already broken and needed to be re-repairedwithout ever being driven by me! The truck stayed at the shopI had already payed the entire bill. 

The second time I went to pick up the vehicle, I could not successfully make it out of the driveway without the new repair '' breaking. See the attached evidence Repair 2 and Repair 2 Location ''. It was at this point that I had to leave the vehicle again.

After three months and two different attempts to pick up the vehicle while already being charged a price that was inaccurately classified and falsified, I tried to pick up the truck. I have been lied to, charged without warning, and the quality is nowhere near adequate. I had already shown the invoice for the labor and parts to multiple other repair shops, and I'm embarrassed even to address how they reacted. I felt like a fool for trusting them and for paying the initially charged fee without first reviewing documentation of what was put into it and by whom. When the vehicle STILL wasnt ready, I ended up just taking my truck off the lot. 

Rays Auto Care was NOT interested in making any adjustments to the original bill, even after we discussed NOT being told up front what the repairs would cost, that much of the work was done WITHOUT consent, and that the items promised and billed for were NOT the ones installed. ( I dont mean to yell, I just want it clear that XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX was not willing to make things right ) After I confronted the owner, the only concession he was willing to make was that he would install a new fuel tank sending unit if I bought the part. See the attached Sending Unit Order. I had the part ready, but after 3 failed attempts to get the car properly conditioned to where I originally paid for it, I lost all trust and confidence in their abilitieseven for a simple install that could be done by removing a few screws from the tank located behind the seats and reattaching some wires. 

Based on the work that was done, I was also not confident of the brakes that were installed. While not what I ordered nor paid for, I still decided to get them tested. Attached is the bill for the work I had done, see Brake Check. The truck wasnt braking correctly and would sometimes be spongy. Turns out there was air in the lines. Glad I got that checked for an additional {$150.00}. 

I've also included call records that I pulled from my wireless bill, as well as text messages. As you can see, it backs up my claims that he was unwilling to move on the price or parts, even though they were NOT what I was told was being paid for and installed, and instead he offered to install a fuel sending unit instead. It also shows that he contracted out the work, which was also never disclosed. Youll see as well the fact that it took a LONG time after I was billed for the parts and labor to actually get the part number for the items that were installed ( which again, were not the ones agreed to and billed for ). Finally, you can see the long history of me having to contact them over the course of months only to finally just get my truck with the work still incomplete because I had lost all confidence in their ability to perform adequte or honest work. The final call on XX/XX/XXXX was me informing them that I was coming to get the truck and was done. As you can see from the billing record I was billed in full on XX/XX/XXXX. They had my truck for about 10 weeks already by the time I was billed ( for what should have been a VERY straight forward job ). From there, I waited an additional 2 weeks for them to try to fix the outstanding issues, but after a couple more failed pick up attempts I removed the truck to have correct work completed elsewhere. The merchant submitted the incomplete invoice and would not work with me on a final, accurate charge for work and parts that were actually completed. 

Lastly, while cleaning out parts that the merchant left in the bed of the truck, I discovered what I believe to be the original spring for the brake pedal, left in between two of the hubcaps that were removed while installing the incorrect brakes ( see "" Brake Spring '' ). It's the right size and painted blue like the rest of the interior, so it was likely thought to be lost and that's when another spring was just dangerously wrapped around the brake pedal. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or more details about the disparities of what was supposed to be installed and what actually was installed. Thank you so much for your assistance on this! My family has been going to this location for decades, but the new ownership is NOT the same and I never would have guessed that charges would have been falsified and the work incomplete when charged. I feel so dumb and taken advantage of for not requiring more information up front before the charge went through, but they would not release my vehicle without payment. The truck itself was only bought for {$6500.00} as a gift from my wife. Theres no way we would have approved almost {$5000.00} in work. It took 3 months to do a break swap. The breaks were NOT the ones agreed to or billed for. The work was never complete. The owner was unwilling to move on the price. The breaks were dangerous with air in the lines, which I had checked and fixed by a 3rd party. All of the items were GROSSLY overpricedon top of the fact that they were not what I was told would be put in. Much of the work was done without consent. Finally, I was pressured and charged before the work was completed. We were lied to and taken advantage of.

I have alerts set up to email or text me on all for accounts for any transactions over {$1.00}. I received an alert on the morning of XX/XX/XXXX for a large transaction. I logged in and saw the charge for {$5600.00} then immediately called my bank. While on hold I ALSO noticed XXXX more smaller charges from the same merchant/signer ( neither of which I have done business with nor are an authorized name on my account ), all for under {$1.00}, 2 days prior. I am an XXXX XXXX for the underwriting division of a major small business lender, so I am very familiar with fraud and the various tactics of these hackers. They were phishing. There were 2 small deposits ( - {$.00} and- {$.00} ) and 1 debit ( {$.00} ). The low amounts would explain why I was not alerted before the larger transaction hit my account 2 days later. They were under my {$1.00} alert limit. 
Upon calling on XX/XX/XXXX, I was transferred to the claims department where I told the claim XXXX about ALL 4 CHARGES and that NONE were authorized. She completed filing my claim and said I would be receiving a provisional credit for the transactions once the larger one cleared as it was still pending when I called. Since it was coming up on the weekend I waited until the following Tuesday to follow up. 
On Tuesday morning XX/XX/XXXX I logged into my account and did not see any credit. So I called. I spoke with a man who I tried to understand his name but I could not and only caught the first letter XXXX or XXXX He advised me claim was closed and denied because they deemed the large transaction authorized since there were XXXX more 2 days prior from the same merchant with the same signer. Again ALL of which I included in my first call. 
The original claims XXXX, whom I did not catch their name, failed to include the first XXXX transactions which resulted in my claim being denied and deemed authorized. 
I then explained to the 2nd claims XXXX I spoke with, that it was clearly a mistake on the 1st claims specialists part and said to even go listen to the recorded call and to please reopen the claim and include ALL the transactions. He put me on hold for approximately 10 mins to speak with his "" back office '' and see what he could do. When he returned he told me there was nothing they could do, the decision was final and I could not reopen the claim. He then said I'd have to take it up with the merchant and request a refund. 
Let me repeat : HE TOLD ME TO CONTACT THE FRAUDULENT MERCHANT AND ASK FOR A REFUND. 
I have never in all my years in the industry ever heard of bank telling a customer such a ridiculous statement. 
After going back and forth and getting nowhere I asked to speak with a XXXX and that is when, after holding another 20 mins, I was transferred to supervisor XXXX. She by far was the XXXX supervisor in a customer service department I have ever spoken to. I barely spoke 10 words when she immediately stopped me from and started to tell me what the claims XXXX told me, that my claim was closed and there was nothing they could do. I kept trying to explain this was not my error, this was clearly a mistake on the part of the original claims XXXX and there had to be a way to just correct it or start a new claim with all the correct information included. She continued to interrupt me and repeat the exact same words, as if I were a child or an XXXX, and she refused to listen. After 4 attempts to get her to understand the issue, I finally just shouted "" stop please you're not listening! '' but before I could finish the words she put me on hold ... for 23 mins. I realize my shout upset her but I was at my wits end with her failure to listen. So I waited. When she finally picked up, I was calm knowing I needed to remain calm and shouting would not help, but she never even gave me the opportunity to speak again and immediately said "" you have overstayed your welcome thank you for banking with chase '' and promptly hung up. 
At this point I began sobbing. I have never felt so helpless and my bank who is supposed to help protect my assets and my accounts, basically aided, and abetted a thief and left me at a complete loss. 
I attempted to calm down and called back. In tears, I asked the customer service rep to please transfer me to a supervisor in the claims department. After another 15mins I was transferred to a supervisor named XXXX who finally took the time to listen to me, even as I kept sobbing thru my explanation of all the above. She was calm and kind and did what none of the other specialists or supervisor were willing to do. She reopened the claim and added the notation that all transactions needed to be included and SHE even noted that the name on the transactions is not an authorized user or signer on the account. She noted that they were like a XXXX verification and the name on the transactions should be a signer on my account as well. She stated that I should hear back in 4-5 days and didn't see why the claim would be declined now that ALL the information was submitted correctly, and it clearly was not someone on my business account. 
On Wednesday XX/XX/XXXX I called in just to confirm that my claim was in fact reopened and included all the information that XXXX stated she added. The XXXX I spoke with by the name of XXXX confirmed it all and then noted that I needed to be sure and go into a bank to open a new account since this one was compromised. To which I told her i already have an appt for next week on XX/XX/XXXX since that is the soonest my bank had available to see me and walk ins would be a long wait. But I am monitoring my account and she did help me place a stop pay for the merchant in the meantime. 
Then yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I logged in to my account to see if there was any update and discovered I received ANOTHER letter identical to the first one ALSO missing the initial XXXX transactions, stating my claim was denied AGAIN! 
I am beside myself and do not know what else to do. I tweeted Chase Customer Service and they messaged me but I honestly do not expect any better service from there. 
I am a victim of theft but Chase and their claims department has failed me, my family and my business leaving us helpless yet again. I have not slept in days and am beyond stressed over how this could have happened or why my own bank is treating me like the criminal instead of helping me. 

Our business is a lifelong dream. We had a restaurant that was closed down after only having been open for 6 months ( and our life savings exhausted ) due to covid. We have been struggling to remain in business as best we can by doing just catering until we can afford the extreme increase in costs the pandemic has caused, so a loss of this amount is devastating to a struggling small business, especially when we are trying to survive week to week while the bills keep coming. 

This is not how a customer should be treated. I chose to bank with Chase when we started our business because of its business banking reputation but THIS... THIS is beyond unacceptable. 
I am upset, disgusted and devastated all at once, that a major bank has shown this small business customer some of the worst customer service I have ever experienced. 
Chase has failed me and I would like to hold them Accountable as well as help getting my claim resolved and my fund returned. 

I will supply all documentation I have to assist in getting my funds back. Thank you in advance.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

The purposes of this, we all know, was that we could go green to protect our environment. Personally, for me, they promised that I could reduce my electrical bill by a very large percentage. Plus, there would be some tax benefit from the government. Before that, XXXX XXXX had partnered with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  and they came together to start everything with me, and later to finance the project. They offered many good terms, such as, no up-front payment, low interest rate for the loan, no payment until the project was done and the system started producing electricity to replace the power from my power company, and there would be a 20-year warranty after the installation to cover the maintenance, repair of the solar system if anything would go wrong in the future. They also promised to repair my roof if any damage was done during the installation process, among other favorable terms. Those were common terms that could have been offered by any other solar installers then and today, because the government was, and still is, backing this kind of projects for the good of the society and the environment. So, I took their offer and signed agreements with both XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX to let them work on the project ( please refer to XXXX bill to me as evidence # 1 ). 
In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent a group of technicians to my home address to do the first partial installation, then they left. I waited for a long time for them to come again to finish the work, but they never came again. Even worse, soon after that, I lost contact with them. After a while ( about in the beginning of XXXX ) I learned that the installer company had declared bankruptcy and no longer in business. I reported this to XXXX XXXX XXXX promised to find someone else to finish the job. Eventually, they found a XXXX-based business called XXXX, to finish the solar project. XXXX ( please refer to XXXX email correspondences to me as evidence # 2 ) contacted me on the phone once and sent me a confirmation email each following month to confirm with me they were actively looking for someone in their network and in my area to do the job. But recently suddenly, XXXX decided not to shoulder their responsibility and refer my case to a collection company ( please see the collection letter as evidence # 3 ) for debt collection. This is not fair to me, and very wrong of XXXX XXXX to do this. 
I would like to make it clear here : {$27000.00} is the total cost for the whole project, including the material cost ( the solar panels ), the installation fee, the hood-up procedure to the power companys power grid, and the warranty service for the next 20 years after the installation. Since this is an unfinished and abandoned project, I would definitely not pay {$27000.00} for the collection. 
I started with a sweet dream of having solar power installed on my roof top ( that is what it was meant to be then, and still is today ), now it becomes a nightmare : I do not have a completed, working solar power system, instead, I am deep in debt to the bank. There supposed to be no immediate big cost to me. Now my electrical bill is the same, in addition to the huge debt I am in. My rights as a consumer have been seriously violated",No,

I called into Charles schwab hundreds of times to resolve discrepancies that were never resolved and on at least one occasion XXXX answered the phone as a Schwab employee. I had several XXXX XXXX dollars embezzled from my Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers brokerage accounts. When I called in asking where the money was they closed my account and banned me from trading and making money in the stock market : I trade for a living which makes this absolutely devastating. I went to the local police and they ignored me. The SEC ignored me. FINRA denied to hear my case. The FBI will not reply. XXXX will not reply. XXXX XXXX XXXX will not reply. I have enough evidence to prove embezzlement and I can prove my former manager was working at the brokerage firm I was trading with. I never had a problem with any of the financial institutions I am affiliated with until after I stopped working under XXXX XXXX and I have not met any other new people since I met her. The only other people I have had contact with since I met XXXX XXXX are my immediate family members and a therapist named XXXX XXXX. I think my former employer XXXX XXXX is sleeping with XXXX XXXX and is helping her sabotage me. I also think my former godfather XXXX XXXX who works for XXXX a XXXX XXXX XXXX is helping XXXX as well. Everyone in my life turned against me after I met XXXX XXXX and started making a lot of money trading in the stock market. If I cant get my money back that they stole along with my trading privileges so I can continue to trade in the stock market again, I will never be able to make enough money to have a family. What there doing to me is a hate crime and because of how rich and powerful XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX are I am afraid that XXXX XXXX is going to get away with it and I will have a lonely miserable life forever. How is it legal for them to steal all my money, discredit me and get me thrown out of the place where I make a living? XXXX XXXX is stalking me and harassing me and graduated up to now stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from me : can someone please go and question these 3 people? At the very least can someone question XXXX XXXX? Isnt it the least bit suspicious that I get thrown out of the brokerage firm she starts working at right after I met her? She got the brokerage industry to discriminate against me for no reason and now my life is ruined. I need someone to help me please. 

The SEC told me to contact the XXXX XXXX XXXX so I did. The XXXX XXXX office informed me to contact you which makes you the end of the line. Will you please investigate the embezzlement with respect to my Charles Schwab and Interactive Brokers brokerage accounts please? 

What XXXX did to me is a racially motivated hate crime. She got me kicked out and banned from 3 brokerage firms and during this time period I never left the house or spoke to anyone so there is nothing I could have done to cause this to happen. All my brokerage relationships became sabotaged and ruined immediately after I spoke to XXXX XXXX on the phone as a schwab employee. Since XXXX was the only non family member besides my therapist XXXX XXXX who knew about my trading activities, I think it is safe to assume that XXXX XXXX is responsible for sabotaging me with the brokerage industry. Why do I have to pay the consequences for her inappropriate, damaging and illegal actions? Since XXXX and I had a previous work relationship, she should not have been allowed to access my brokerage account from the back end. There is a legal requirement for financial institutions to maintain impartiality with respect to their clients and XXXX did everything to disrespect and to not maintain impartiality. Financial professionals should never manage accounts of clients that they have had a personal relationship or affiliation with. Ive had a previous affiliation with XXXX XXXX so why is she being allowed to access my brokerage accounts? I kept a diary in my schwab account documenting all the illegal sabotaging changes they made within my account and I believe XXXX XXXX illegal accessed, read and obtained my diary along with my intellectual property contained in it. She proceeded to share my IP with other people where she misrepresented what I wrote to incite other employees to sabotage me more. All XXXX does is collect personal information on me illegally and then she disclosed this information to people shes not supposed to disclose to with the sole intent of slandering me, defaming my character and tarnishing my reputation. In finance sometimes your reputation is all you have especially within a brokerage Industry. XXXX slandered me and talked XXXX on me so much that it caused other employees to hate on me. XXXX XXXX even contacted other brokerage firms after they banned me to sabotage me the same as Schwab had done. Thats exactly what happened when I went to Interactive Brokers after I was let go from schwab. XXXX embezzled all my trading profits and then closed my account when I asked where the missing funds were.",Yes,"Category 2.

I lived at the XXXX at XXXX apartments from XX/XX/XXXX - XX/XX/XXXX. I enjoyed my time there, however I have XXXX kids, my son is now XXXX XXXX XXXX and my daughter is now XXXX XXXX XXXX and we have a dog so with my family getting older, dog getting bigger, I wanted to find a home where my kids have room to grow and enjoy friends over, so I decided to find a house and move out of an apartment. 
Over those XXXX years, I built a great partnership with XXXX XXXX in the leasing office as she was XXXX of the people I met when I moved in. In my XXXX years there, I was never delinquent without letting them know ahead of time and paying all necessary fees. So when I went to the office on XX/XX/XXXX with my son, I talked to XXXX XXXX about a home we found and we were moving out and I wanted to make sure I followed the move out process. We completed a walk through inspection of my home but stated I needed to leave my keys and fob on the kitchen counter when I moved out on XX/XX/XXXX and because the apartment complex was changing from XXXX  at XXXX to another company ( now is called the XXXX at XXXX ) I could leave without a fee but I was forfeiting my deposit. She even gave me a rental reference on my new home which I moved into on XX/XX/XXXX ( please see the attachment Tenant Rental Verification ). To ensure things were documented, I sent an email on XX/XX/XXXX and recapped the move out ( Please see email XXXX XXXX move out. 
I am not perfect by any means but I have been trying to purchase a home and I have been trying to maintain my credit, my bills and obligations for the last year, so I can afford my home. I have attached my credit report so you could see I am definitely trying. I found the home I was interested in purchasing and you can XXXX to my surprise when I was denied due to XXXX at XXXX putting on my credit report an eviction and a balance of {$7900.00}. I had no prior balance ( please see a copy of the XXXX rent receipt and confirmation ) so I have no idea where this amount is coming from, secondly, I completed all the necessary steps and left on good terms, so how was this an eviction when I was already out of the apartment and they knew it so I was never properly served. Another thing to consider is why did they wait so long for the eviction if indeed they thought I was still there? Since I have been there for 3 years, they have all my contact information. Why wait almost 2 months before doing anything, when I have been paying rent on time? This was a deliberate act of sabotage towards me and my family. 
I immediately created an account with XXXX, XXXX and XXXX to see if this was on all my accounts and it was under XXXX at XXXX on XXXX, XXXX and XXXX had a collection agency called XXXX XXXX XXXX with their information representing the XXXX at XXXX ( Please see a copy of my credit report marked Collections document. ). This was done erroneously, so the order to appear never reached me because I had already vacated and it was not mailed to my new address so I had no idea I needed to appear in court, which brought me to filing a motion to set Aside Judgment which I did on XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX. In my research for the case, I saw another private credit agency named Brett M. Borland LLC was provided this erroneous information and has consistently been sending this information out to the other bureaus ( please see document attached ). The representative sent me a copy of the information the XXXX at XXXX had provided and I noticed they knew I had left because it was sent to them on XX/XX/XXXX ( which is different than what was advised to myself and the Judge ) that they filed the Writ of Possession in XXXX because they didnt know I left ( please see ruling document from the Judge ). I have sent numerous dispute debt letters to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, Brett M Borland and XXXX XXXX XXXX but none of the agencies have removed this off my credit report as a collection ( please reference the Debt Dispute Letters attached ). I sent the court documents so they could see this is indeed not in collections because the amount is wrong and I was not evicted. 
I went to court on XX/XX/XXXX and the Judge was XXXX XXXX and all sides presented, the Judge asked me to provide the figures of the true amount and present to the Plaintiff ( please see attached document called Settlement Stipulations ) and once I did submit they sent an email stating they did not agree ( please see email attached ) and there has been no further discussion since.

The total purchase amount was {$1000.00}, {$700.00} of that total amount was a gift card and {$320.00} was charged to the aforementioned B of A Visa card. On XXXX, I decided to return the bike/helmet and look for something different. When I returned the items, a XXXX XXXX  employee issued a return credit to my B of A Visa for the total amount of {$1000.00}. 

Several days later, when I attempted to use my XXXX card for a purchase, it was declined. On XX/XX/XXXX, I called the toll free phone number on the back of the card, ( XXXX ) XXXX, to inquire as to the reason my card did not work. An automated message told me the account had been closed. I then entered prompts to speak with a representative. I was told that my account was frozen and I needed to fax a copy of the return receipt and the account should be restored within 48 hours. On XX/XX/XXXX, I faxed a copy of the return receipt. I was only told that the reason for the freeze was that the return amount credited to the card ( {$1000.00} ) was greater than the purchase made on the card ( {$320.00} ). 

Several days later, I called the toll free number and discovered the account was still closed. I again entered prompts to speak with a representative. After explaining my issue, I was placed on hold for 30 minutes. At the end of this 40 minute call, I was told everything was cleared and my account access should be restored in 10 minutes. Within 5 minutes of hanging up, I received a call from ( XXXX ) XXXX. I answered and it was a representative from Bank of America accounting.

On XX/XX/XXXX, I again resent the fax with a copy of the receipts that had been made as dark as I could make them on my home printer/copier.

After all this time, I was told that because the amount returned was greater than the purchase, it shows up as a deposit and deposits can not be made into this type of account. I was again denied access to my account funds ( in excess of {$6000.00} ). 

I was then told I have to go back to retailer and ask them to refund the pending/ held amount ( {$700.00} ) into a different card account. This did not seem reasonable and I asked for this policy/ directive to given to me in writing so that I could present it to the retailer ( XXXX XXXX ).

Upon arriving to the hotel, I noticed that the exterior as well as the lobby area, looked completely different from the pictures that were posted. Being that it was almost XXXX, and I had my toddler with me. I proceeded to check in. Upon checking into the hotel room, I noticed that it was absolutely filthy. Stains and crumbs on the floors, the tissue in the bathroom was a half used roll, with stains on it. There were poorly patched holes in the wall, and overall it was just XXXX of the filthiest hotel rooms that Ive ever been in. We stayed in the room for about XXXX minutes. I then went to tuck my daughter in and pulled back the sheets only to find a huge red stain underneath them. This was the absolute last straw. I got myself and my daughter redressed and proceeded to the front desk to either check out or be switched to a room that had actually been cleaned and prepared for guest arrival. When I arrived at the front desk, I waited about XXXX minutes for the manager to ultimately tell me that there were no more rooms available for the night, he said that my only option would be to check out and that he would issue me a refund. He suggested that I give XXXX a call the next morning, and explain the situation to them, seeing as though they were who I booked with. The next morning, I did just that. Upon calling XXXX, they proceeded to call the hotel on the other line, and according to them, the hotel was unwilling to authorize a refund. I was baffled. I reached out to XXXX Hotels Corporate office the next day via email, attaching pictures and describing my visit in detail, and I told them that a refund should be very least theyre willing to do, being as though I didnt even spend XXXX night in the room that I booked for XXXX nights due to poor sanitation. A couple of days went by, and their corporate team emailed me stating that On their end, its showing that a refund has been processed. At this time, I was pressed for cash, so I had already disputed the transaction with my bank and received a temporary credit. Being that I went through all of this, I had no idea that my bank would end up denying the dispute. About a month and a half later, they did just that. The temporary credit was removed and I was left with a negative balance in my account, which caused me to accumulate over {$300.00} in overdraft fees from XXXX to XXXX. I reopened the dispute, providing my bank with pictures of the hotel room, as well as an email that I shared with the corporate office, however my bank ( Chase ) refused to give me my money back, and so did XXXX. I called the hotel and they informed me that they couldnt authorize the refund since i booked via XXXX. XXXX told me that they couldnt authorize a refund without the hotels approval. I got the run around for almost XXXX weeks about this issue, and ultimately I never saw my money againSo, essentially I was cheated out of {$170.00}. Not to mention the financial hardship that I faced after they removed the temporary credit and my account went into a negative balance. I have reached out to almost everyone I can think of about this ( XXXX, Pricelines escalation team, Chase, Chase Dispute Department ). And Im really starting to feel taken advantage of. There is no way possible that it can be right, let alone legal, for a company to refuse to give you a refund when their services or products are no where near the standard of which you were led to believe they were. Im truly hoping that something can be done about this, and that this issue can be resolved. Im not okay with my money just being gone like this.

I realize with the influx of calls that getting our money back could take a while but its very concerning to me that theyre saying this entire process can take 6 months to a year when every single other student loan provider has a way quicker turnaround despite having thousands of requests as well. Currently, getting that money back would be life-changing for me as well as many others. So seeing other peoples loan providers reinstating their balance after requesting it just 36-72 hours later makes me very concerned that this company does not have our best interests at heart.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

During XXXX XXXX XXXX I made total payments of {$9500.00}. After reading about the CAREs act and the policy to request a refund, I followed the instructions to contact your loan servicer to request a refund. and called MyFedLoan. I spoke with a gentleman and explained that I would like a refund of all {$9500.00} made toward my student loans. He immediately understood what I was referring to with the CAREs act and told me he would submit the refund request. He then told me it would take between 2 weeks and 2 months to receive my refund but that at any time I could call MyFedLoan customer service and get an update. After the first 2 weeks passed, I gave MyFedLoan a call. They told me that any refund request was out of their hands and they couldnt provide an update, they informed me to wait a couple of weeks and try back again. I happily obliged and waited. After an additional 2 weeks I called back, same information was given to me. Only this time I was told to call the department of treasury who would handle the refund and any updated. I got a number and called, the treasury department told me they had no record of a refund request. I called MyFedLoan once again, explained the situation, and was told to wait a couple of weeks and try to call for an update with MyFedLoan. I obliged and waited. 2 weeks later, now 6 weeks since my original request of refund, I called and was told to call the IRS because they will provide you with an update. They gave me a number which I called and the IRS said they had no record of my refund or any idea what I was talking about. I called MyFedLoan back and was told to wait a couple of weeks for the money to arrive and call back if it didnt come. I obliged. After another 2 weeks ( 8 weeks in total now ) I called XXXX who told me to call StudentAid because theyll have the update on your refund. They gave me a number that I called and StudentAid told me they had no record of my refund request and that they had no idea what I was talking about. I called back XXXX who told me to wait an additional 2 weeks to give the 2 month time frame sufficient leeway. I obliged. After 2 weeks ( 2.5 months later ) I called XXXX who told me to call the department of treasury, again. I explained that I already tried them but MyFedLoan insisted they would be able to help. They gave me a new number which I called and the treasury department had no idea what I was talking about nor a record of refund. I called XXXX back who told me to wait 1 week and call back MyFedLoan for help. I begged someone to help me now since it had been over the 2 month threshold but they assured me it was absolutely out of their hands. Then I asked MyFedLoan customer service rep do you at least see a record of me calling back in XXXX to request a refund to which she told me that they keep no records of such refunds and she promised the refund was coming and to call back in 1 week for an update. I obliged. After 1 week I called MyFedLoan who told me to call the department of education. They gave me a number which I called and the department of education had no idea what I was talking about, nor a record of any refund request. I called MyFedLoan back who assured me that after 2 more weeks I should call back. I obliged. After 2 more weeks, now 3.5 months after my initial refund request, I called MyFedLoan who told me to call Federal Student Loan Ombudsman Group. I reluctantly agreed and called the number XXXX gave me. After speaking with the Ombudsman group and explaining this awful situation, they swore to me that MyFedLoan has to have some kind of record of my refund request and that MyFedLoan were the only people that would be able to help me. I called back MyFedLoan on XX/XX/2022 and explained all of the above to the customer service rep who got a manager on the phone. I explained again the entire situation from the beginning and the manager said Oh, yes I do see a note here on your account that you requested a refund back in XXXX but that we never actually submitted it, Im sorry Ill submit that now. Please wait between 2 weeks and 2 months for the refund to come. I wanted to cry. After all of the phone tag I played and the misinformation MyFedLoan gave me, it all turned out to be pointless because they forgot to submit the request. Before she submitted the request I informed her that my bank account on file was closed and that I had a new bank account. She told me she couldnt do anything about that and on XX/XX/2022 the actual request went in to be sent to my old, closed bank account. They told me to call back after 2 weeks for an update. I obliged. After a couple weeks on XX/XX/XXXX I called and the person on the phone at MyFedLoan told me that the refund was sent that day, XX/XX/2022 and I should see it in my old and closed bank account. I explained that the bank account they sent the money to was closed to which she told me after we attempt to send it to a closed account, the transaction will bounce back and then we will need to mail you a paper check which can take up to 6 months. I wanted to cry. I asked to speak with a manager who told me the exact same thing. On XX/XX/XXXX I called back again to see if they had an update on the paper check being sent. They told me that my loans had been transferred to a new loan servicer, XXXX. It is now XX/XX/XXXX. 5 months later, no idea where my refund it, I am devastated and angry.",Yes,"Category 2.

Once I called again SEVERAL times, then they informed me that the decision was made to take back the money.

I had a balance of {$260.00} that was due on XX/XX/XXXX, I paid off the balance on XX/XX/XXXX in the amount of {$260.00} ( 18 days before my due date, no residual interest ). For the next month, my balance should have been {$0.00} but they charged me an interest of {$2.00} on a {$0.00} balance, including a charge of {$0.00} for account protection ( Account XXXX which I have no confirmation of signing up for ). In fact, I have an email stating that I am not signed up for it. Regardless, based on their guidelines for Account XXXX, you are not to be charged when there is a {$0.00} balance. 
Then late fees and more finance charges were added in the total of {$6.00}, which I paid of on XX/XX/XXXX. 
The next month in XXXX I have a finance charge on my statement again, including late fees and charges for account XXXX. The same charges were added and I once again paid it off on XX/XX/XXXX. 
Please note I closed the account on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX received a confirmation letter from them. At that time, I asked about the charges and they agreed they would remove them. 
To this day, I am still getting calls to pay what is supposedly owed even though I explained I have already cleared my balance and asked why they are charging interest or finance fees, adding account XXXX  charges and late fees on a {$0.00} balance. Today I called Comenity Bank, and they gave me the run-around, placing me on several long-holds several times. I asked to speak to a manager or supervisor since I had already resolved this issue in XXXX. In the end, they alleged the system was not working and to call back. 
If I pay this balance which is now around $ XXXX, I fear they will forward a finance charge on a paid balance of {$0.00} again and this cycle will continue and will never be paid/cleared. 
I feel this is consumer/credit card fraud.

5971613,09/13/22,Credit card or prepaid card,Problem when making payments,"I have a Citicard. I had a deferred interest promotion which expired on XX/XX/XXXX. Before my deferred interest promotion expired, I also obtained a flex loan from the same credit card. The deferred interest was 0 % and the flex loan at 5.99 %. 

Under 12 CFR Part 1026 ( Regulation Z ), XXXX XXXX. i. states : ( i ) Last two billing cycles. The card issuer must allocate any amount paid by the consumer in excess of the required minimum periodic payment consistent with paragraph ( a ) of this section, except that, during the two billing cycles immediately preceding expiration of the specified period, the excess amount must be allocated first to the balance subject to the deferred interest or similar program and any remaining portion allocated to any other balances consistent with paragraph ( a ) of this section I attempted to pay off my deferred interest balance in XX/XX/XXXX and again in XX/XX/XXXX, prior to the expiration date of my deferred interest balance XX/XX/XXXX. Citi allocated the minimum to my deferred interest balance 0 % and the rest to my flex loan 5.99 %. They told me that they had to make the payment to the flex loan per federal regulation that requires the extra payments go to the higher interest rate. Clearly, they are not following section b of the reg cited above. Addtionally, prior to my payment in XXXX, I reached out to Citi via the chat feature to make sure that my payment would be applied with the minimum to the flex loan ( 5.99 % ) and the extra to the deferred interest balance. The Citi chat person told me that is how it would be applied. Additionally, when making the payment online, I clicked the payment option stating "" pay Adjusted New Balance plus Flex Plan Monthly Payment '' which was the exact total of my remaining deferred interest balance plus the minimum payment of the flex loan. Clearaly, any reasonable person would assume by checking this box their payment would be allocated per the stated payment option! 

The result is that I am now stuck paying the 22.49 % interest rate on the remaining deferred interest balance that I attempted to pay off twice! My interest is now higher every month. This is clearly unreasonable and it does not follow 1026.53 b.

I hope that you will look into this and rectify it. Clearly section 1026.53 b. was drafted becasue of this exact situation. A consumer should not be forced to pay interest on a deferred balance when they've attempted to pay it off more than once.

5977749,09/13/22,Debt collection,Written notification about debt,"Hello, I'm reporting 3 or 4 companies that have been working together as Collection Agencies bouncing my liability around between them and passing me around in circles as I try to resolve this matter that is being incorrectly reported to my Credit. I'm in the process of buying a home and they reported 8 separate collections for 4 accounts that were paid within 7 days of receiving notice. 

I've spent months working with these companies to try and clear this up and nobody is able to provide any information as to who is reporting. 

The debts were originally owned by XXXX XXXX, which is an abbreviation for XXXX XXXX reporting for XXXX XXXX. We were working together to resolve the debt while I was living in XXXX and they told me they sold the debt because the company was closing down ( apparently due to violations ). I was told the new debtor would be in touch so we can resolve this matter. 

Although I an enormous amount of time trying to get in touch with someone, I never heard back. Finally, I found out that XXXX was short for XXXX XXXX and they reopened as XXXX. I was able to contact someone there who told me that another company called FBCS now owned the debt. 

I reached out to FBCS and spoke to a gentleman named XXXX XXXX. He mentioned that XXXX XXXX never provided my updated Contact Information and they were unable to reach me. We discussed the debt and he told me an amount that these accounts can be settled for. I mentioned my concerns on multiple occasions regarding this being reported to my credit while I am going through the home buying process and he repeatedly told me that they do not report to credit and it wouldn't have a negative impact. This was less than a week after we initially got in touch so well within my grace period. The call had a my Bank representative on the phone as well. 

After paying the debt, the collection accounts were removed and I put a deposit down for my new home. A few weeks later, they started reporting the 4 accounts twice each which is showing up as 8 collections. 

I was told to contact XXXX XXXX the manger at FBCS and have been trying to work this out with him for months. He told me that he was reaching out to his contacts at XXXX XXXX after listening to a recording of our calls and he was requesting they delete the reporting from credit. After 2 months of constant follow ups, I reached out to my credit company and they told me they have never seen something reported like this before and it was incorrect and I should file a complaint with FBCS. 

When I told XXXX that I would be doing so, he put me in touch with a higher up at FBCS named "" XXXX '', who said he was reaching out to "" his people '' at XXXX XXXX to have this removed. He told me that he would be in touch within 2 days with Deletion Letters for the 3 Credit Buraus and I never heard back although followed up a few times. 

Now, XXXX XXXX reached back out and gave me a general email for XXXX XXXX and told me that I have to try and reach them. 

I have no clue who to reach out to and I am being put in circles after they collected the money. I never received any disclosures, letters, or communication regarding this. Now, I am supposed to be closing on my home and risk losing my life savings in a deposit as well as my housing because of this. I have lost sleep for months over this and it is not being handled correctly by XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ), XXXX, XXXX XXXX, or FBCS.

I logged into my accounts I saw a total of {$37000.00} had been transferred from my savings account on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called the XXXX number on the back on my Chase debit card. The representative told me my debit card would be cancelled but the saving account issue would require me to contact a different department the next day between XXXX XXXX. She told me she was giving me their direct number ( XXXX ) XXXX and to select option # XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX called the given number and spent XXXX hours, speaking to XXXX different individuals. The third person shared that my money was transferred to a newly opened business account "" XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX '' in XXXX TX. She inquired if I had any affiliation with this business, I responded "" No ''. After more questions she told me the fraud department would be investigating the situation and would be in touch. She asked if I would like to be kept informed of the progress. I responded, "" of course ''. I didn't hear anything for five days. 

XX/XX/XXXX I went to my branch to speak to them and check on the status of my situation.

They felt that I was a victim of identity theft and recommended that I file a police report. The rep on the phone said my accounts would be froze and I would need to open new accounts. 

Next, XXXX relayed the individual who is impersonating me had withdrawn money from the fraudulent business account and as is Chases policy, a 10 day wait period would mean the check would be sent out in exactly XXXX business days, on XX/XX/XXXX. Since the business account is in my name it would be sent to the address on the fraudulent business account : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, TX XXXX. In order for me to get my money back I would have to put a stop payment on this check. XXXX provided the number ( XXXX ) XXXX and to select option # 1. The claim number for this situation is XXXX.

XX/XX/XXXX Opened new bank accounts. XXXX XXXX XXXX shared information that the individual who had done this actually went into the branch in XXXX. He authenticated me and asked me for my signature. He then showed me the withdrawl slips the person completed. It was clear our signatures are different and we are not the same person.

I went back to the XXXX branch and met with the branch XXXX, XXXX XXXX. He authenticated me. XXXX made the call for me, and was told the claim had been closed as of XX/XX/XXXX. He questioned this and finally the rep decided to open a new claim for identity theft # XXXX. 

I was told the fraudulent XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX business account was flagged and the imposter had been contacted via phone and email to come to the branch to be authenticated but had not shown up. XXXX told me I would be receiving a packet to complete regarding this claim and to fill out and include the police report, when I was done to bring back to them and they would fax for me. 

XX/XX/XXXX My husband and I went to the branch and met with XXXX again. I had received and completed the packet Identity Theft Declaration of Claimant and he faxed with the police report for me.

On XX/XX/XXXX I called Chase to inquire about the transfer that should have been happened on XX/XX/XXXX. I spent XXXX hours on the phone.

I had no prior balance ( please see a copy of the XXXX rent receipt and confirmation ) so I have no idea where this amount is coming from, secondly, I completed all the necessary steps and left on good terms, so how was this an eviction when I was already out of the apartment and they knew it so I was never properly served. Another thing to consider is why did they wait so long for the eviction if indeed they thought I was still there? Since I have been there for 3 years, they have all my contact information. Why wait almost 2 months before doing anything, when I have been paying rent on time? This was a deliberate act of sabotage towards me and my family.

I have sent numerous dispute debt letters to XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and National Credit Systems but none of the agencies have removed this off my credit report as a collection ( please reference the Debt Dispute Letters attached ).

The claim had been denied by BofA who stated that I didn't establish that the Car Radiator which XXXX sold and shipped to me was damaged, although XXXX accepted the damage claim but simply refused to have their damaged radiator retrieved from where it was delivered which was my house. 

The Suspect knew my full name, including my middle name which almost nobody knows. The Suspect also knew the last four ( 4 ) digits of my SSN, the last four ( 4 ) Digits of my Credit Card Number, the last four ( 4 ) digits of my checking account, date of birth, and my physical home address.

Because the Suspect knew the above-mentioned personal and banking information, knew about my XXXX dispute claim, and informed me that the conversation was being tape-recorded as Bank of America does all the time, I was convinced he was a legitimate Bank of America employee . 

After the suspect asked what was damaged on the Car Radiator, I explained how the dented and bent car radiator came in a severely damaged and taped box. The suspect then told me that he needed to verify my identity and asked for my complete Social Security Number before he accepted my XXXX claim and refund my money. Since he knew about my XXXX claim, and the fact the suspect knew my personal and financial information, and told me the conversation was being recorded, I assumed he was a legitimate Bank of America employee as he followed BofA protocols. 

After jumping through hoops and doing all that was required of me by Bank of America, NA, I received a letter that BofA was "" DENYING my $ XXXX Fraud claim. BofA rejected my fraud claim despite me going to my XXXX Branch 3 times, having the Bank fax all of the required signed documents, including a brief summary, providing XXXX XXXX Sheriff 's crime report number, documents, etc. that BofA required. 

For the record, I spoke with XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) and Supervisor XXXX XXXX ( phone number ( XXXX ) XXXX ), in person at our XXXX, California BofA Branch who tried to assist me in this matter. 

I spent approximately over 10 hours on hold with Credit Card Fraud and XXXX Fraud BofA employees which my cell phone records will confirm besides my three ( 3 ) in-person visits. Ironically a BofA XXXX employee stated on the phone that they never received the XXXX Bank of America branch Staff sent to them but XXXX XXXX XXXX, the XXXX XXXX Bank employee showed me on the computer that the Faxes were sent. 

Please note that I also made numerous calls to BofA and was transferred to various departments and relayed the facts of the fraud incident, asking them to document the fraud. 

During my last call to Bank of America, I spoke with a female employee who identified herself as a "" Floor Supervisor '' by the name of "" XXXX '', employee number # XXXX, who told me that since I was a victim of a "" Scam '', they would not cover the Credit Card or XXXX fraud Claim of $ XXXX. 

I asked XXXX why they would not cover the Credit Card or XXXX fraud claim. She said because I gave the Criminals my SSN. I told her that the Fraud transfers didn't come from my computer IP address nor my cell phone on file to perpetrate this fraud and that "" BofA often asks for my full Social Security Number '', and I reminded supervisor XXXX that to be transferred to speak to her regarding this matter, "" they ( BofA ) also demanded my full Social Security Number ''. Supervisor XXXX then "" admitted '' that at times "" BofA does demand the complete Social but she said that was only to find the file ''. I then asked Supervisor XXXX, "" are we as non-BoA employees supposed to know that ''? She admitted that we aren't supposed to know that as non-Bank of America employees. By the way, XXXX also informed me that our conversation was being recorded. 

Bank of America never warned me that "" XXXX '' was unsafe to use and that millions have been defrauded and that they owned XXXX, and ergo are biased in denying their victim 's claims. Bank of America refused to refund the money stolen via fraudulent means through XXXX despite the fact the transfers were not made by me, done without my knowledge or consent, and were "" not done on my phone nor computer '' which should have been a "" Red Flag Warning to BofA and XXXX '' that criminal activity was occurring, and they should have stopped the transfers to the criminal ( XXXX ). 

I would like to file a formal complaint in hopes of obtaining relief from XXXX and Bank of America. The XXXX caps consumer liability for unauthorized electronic fund transfers at {$50.00} and the transactions at issue exceed that amount. 15 U.S.C. 1693g ( a ).

On XX/XX/XXXX, I lost these two cards by accident which I had not used at all and immediately reported to the Vanilla Visa Gift Card issuing company ( InComm Inc. ) by filing this lost card case on the phone ( # XXXX ). 

I have reported two lost Vanilla Gift Cards ( Value of {$500.00} each ) on XX/XX/XXXX and tried several times ( XXXX emails on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and FAX on XX/XX/XXXX ) to send required documentation to your department and was finally notified by email on XX/XX/XXXX that my dispute packet has been received and forwarded to the Dispute Resolution Team for review and investigation. 

I was told to wait for 90 days since XX/XX/XXXX till the dispute team has a final resolution. I waited till the XX/XX/XXXX and called to follow up for the resolution and supervisor team told me on XX/XX/XXXX replacement cards were sent. I have never received them. So I waited 30 business days since XX/XX/XXXX to request another sets of replacement to be mailed to me. 

On XX/XX/XXXX when I called the customer service team and I was told replacement cards were sent out by mail for the second attempt on XX/XX/XXXX and I need to wait for 30 business day. Again, I didnt receive them. 

I called the customer service supervisor team to follow up routinely every month from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX trying to find out the following but never got the answer : 1. Whats the dispute resolution? 
2. Final amount remaining on both cards 3. To request refund thru check in the mail instead of waiting for the replacement cards ( mailed to me on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ) which never arrive The supervisor team always told me to wait for 48 hours for updates from the back office ( Dispute Department ). This became an indefinite loop that I never received any updates from the back office and I had to call back over and over to follow up every month on this lost card claim status which has no progress at all. 

The image of the original purchase receipt of the cards have the serial number which is the same number appeared on the back of the Visa Gift Card package and their customer service team advised me that as long as the back office ( Dispute Department ) receives the information of original purchase receipts image and my ID, they can review, locate the gift cards information and investigate any unauthorized transactions and to have a final resolution by 90 days after the date XX/XX/XXXX which I was told the dispute package that was received. 

At this point, I really need your help to assist me to deal with InComm Inc. ( the gift card issuing company ) to resolve this issue. I have tried every opportunity to get status updates but I cant really get any assistance from their back office team and calling customer service line routinely every month didnt help me at all on this situation. 

It has been almost six months passed from the previous attempt of mailing out the replacement cards and almost one year from the date when I reported this lost card case. 

Please let me know whats the next step from this complaint filing at Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Thank you so much!

Was left two Voicemails by two different representative from Chase Executive Office telling me that I could withdraw the money that they had restricted in my account from any Branch. 

Voicemail Dates and Times : XXXXXXXX from Chase Executive Office XX/XX/22 XXXX XXXX pst XXXX ext XXXX XXXX from Chase Executive Office XX/XX/22 XXXX XXXX XXXX  XXXX ext XXXX I have attached both voicemails to this case to confirm that both representatives told me incorrect information, and I lost over an hour of my time. They both claimed I could get my money from the branch, and that I was later denied. 

( I have been unable to reach both representatives every time I have called back. Even though they said if I have any questions, to contact them at their extensions. I have called over ten times and have never been able to reach either of them. Every single call goes straight to their voicemail so I am not entirely sure why they say to contact them with any questions and give their extensions. ) Both Voicemails stated that I can go to a Chase branch and withdraw my my money, {$1500.00} is in my account. Both executives stated the branch would be able to contact the back office, or the executive office and their extensions, and give me my funds. 

I went to the branch at XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, CA XXXX at XXXX on XX/XX/22. 
After a back and forth with over two representatives, I was sat down with a banker, after two representatives, and waiting, this was over 30 minutes. 

After, the banker attempted to call the "" back office '' and they said there were no notes on the account, and they're unable to give me my money. 

I called XXXX from Chase Executive Office, it went to voicemail. Same with XXXX 's extension. I re-dialed to the main executive office line, and asked for XXXX. They were able to connect the call. So perhaps the calls to the extensions are automatically sent to voicemail and they only provide them for regulatory purposes. 

After, XXXX spoke with the banker, and branch manager for over 30 minutes. I was unable to withdraw my funds. The executive office representative, XXXX, was telling the Branch manager to release my funds, and the Branch manager, was declining. 

I need my money now, and do not understand why I can not get my funds. I can not wait any longer. XXXX and Chase said the account would not be closed till XX/XX/22. I can not wait another week to get my money, only after it is closed, they could send a check that might take 7-10 business days, ( potentially another two weeks ), and could potentially get lost or stolen in the mail. Very unsecure method, versus being able to take my money out from a branch, which I need now, and is much more secure. 

I am filing another CFPB case and contacting regulatory agencies because my previous attempts have seen to been going unaddressed and or given false/wrong information, such as being able to go to a branch location and get my money, and then spending over one hour of my time, and being denied in the end with the executive office representative and branch manager disagreeing.

XXXX XXXX, the alleged landscaper, sprayed various chemicals on our lawn and killed our grass. We were told the lawn was properly fertilized and seeded. Instead, he sprayed toxic chemicals on our lawn, and covered the lawn with mulch and topsoil to cover the evidence. That weekend, it took two days to remove the thick mulch and topsoil on our grass to discover the lawn completely destroyed. It was yellow, brown, and black. Some spots were completely bare. 

We filed an immediate police report on XX/XX/2022 against XXXX XXXX with the XXXX XXXX Sherrif 's Department in XXXX XXXX, CA. XXXX XXXX scammed us by offering a fraudulent service as a professional landscaper. Other neighbors as well got conned and scammed.

I also filed a case with the Federal Trade Commission # XXXX. 

Unfortunately, we were victims of a fraud crime. This was a case of bad service, fraud, and services not rendered. We are requesting our payment to XXXX XXXX be refunded back to XXXX based on fraud. 

On XX/XX/2022, I filed a fraud case with our bank, Wells Fargo, within 10 days. Nobody from Wells Fargo called me, emailed me, texted me, or sent me a letter in the mail regarding my case. They did not know any details regarding my case. However, on XX/XX/2022, I was send a letter from Wells Fargo declining my fraud claim. Wells Fargo states on their website they research fraud claims.

15 U.S.C 1681 section 602 A. States, I have the right to privacy.

15 U.S.C. 1681 ( a ) ( 4 ) There is a need to insure that consumer reporting agencies exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect for the consumers right to privacy.

15 U.S.C 1681b ( a ) ( 2 ) - nothing can be furnished on my consumer report without my written consent 15 U.S. Code 1611 - Criminal liability for willful and knowing violation Whoever willfully and knowingly ( 1 ) gives false or inaccurate information or fails to provide information which he is required to disclose under the provisions of this subchapter or any regulation issued thereunder, 15 U.S.C 1692 ( C ) Without the prior consent of the consumer given directly to the debt collector or the express permission of a court of competent jurisdiction, a debt collector may not communicate with a consumer in connection with the collection of any debt.

15 U.S.C. 1681-11681x The Act ( Title VI of the Consumer Credit Protection Act ) protects information collected by consumer reporting agencies such as credit bureaus, medical information companies, and tenant screening services. Information in a consumer report can not be provided to anyone who does not have a purpose specified in the Act. Companies that provide information to consumer reporting agencies also have specific legal obligations, including the duty to investigate disputed information. In addition, users of the information for credit, insurance, or employment purposes must notify the consumer when an adverse action is taken on the basis of such reports. 
Therefore I want the following accounts to be updated to the correct amount, date, status, open and closed date, last date of activity, and time. 
If you can not complete this request, please delete the accounts immediately. I have provided an exhibit of evidence showing the inaccuracies of my reports.

5974634,09/12/22,Mortgage,Trouble during payment process,"1. I paid XXXX XXXX {$12000.00} for High Grade Wood Grain Porceline Tiling for my entire home. Included in the receipt was labor and all other materials to remove the damaged carpeting in the Livingroom, Hallway, Master Bedroom & Master Bedroom Closet and install the new tiling.. 

2. Shortly thereafter, I received a letter from the Repairs Department at Longbridge Financial stating that {$7600.00} was being withheld for required repairs as well as a required Contractors Affidavit of Confitional Waiver of Lien required for complaince with my Reverse Mortgage Agreement. 

3. I called their Repairs Department and was told that once the repairs were made, to send in my invoices, reciepts and the Waiver of Lien. I was advised that once received, I would be contacted by the Repair Department to schedule a HUD Inspector out to my home to confirm work was completed and was in compliance with HUD Standards. Once the inspector submits his/her report, Longbridge would return the withheld {$7600.00} to my equity line of credit. 

4. I had to go back and forth between XXXX XXXX and their XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to determine who was the party responsible for completing your Lien Waiver. It took me 2 weeks to get that issue resolved. 

5. XXXX XXXX finally sent me the Waiver of Lien, and I forwarded it to XXXX. XXXX XXXX XXXX sent me thier company Waiver of Lien, not the one from Longbridge, so I contacted the Repair Department and was told to send XXXX XXXX 's waiver in..

6.The mid week in XXXX, Longbridge called me and advised me they were going to contract a HUD Inspector out to my home to confirm repairs had been made. They said it could take up to 2 weeks to have an inspector come out, and I was fine with that.. 

7. Around the last week in XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent out thier HUD Inspector ( Who was actually the same appraiser that came out when I initially applied for my Reverse Mortgage with XXXX XXXX XXXX is a very small community and there are very few professionals in XXXX XXXX XXXX .Anyway, he came out, he took pictures of the areas repaired and he submitted his report. 

8. The next thing I know, the Inspector was on the phone with me saying Longbridge kicked his report back to them telling the Inspector to change the name of the Business noted as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  ( The Mortgage Broker I applied for a Reverse Mortgage through ) and to change the name on his report to Longbridge Financial. I didn't understand why he was so upset and literally livid at the request, He began telling me that what they asked for was not legal, therefor could not be done. I told him to contact Longbridge directly, but was told they couldn't get through on the phone. 

9. I decided to do a conference call with the HUD Inspector, Longbridge Financial and myself, which ended up becomibng a shouting match because the Repairs Representative would not listen to his concernes nor mine. She would not and refused to transfer us to a Supervisor, nor would she provide us with any information on how to speak with a supervisor to find a solution to the issue. 

10. The HUD Inspector then called FHA or HUD to verify that he was correct in that changing the Lender name on his report would be illegal, and XXXX  informed me that he was correct per FHA/HUD. 

11. The following day, XXXX  called me and said that their requirement to change the name on his report had been dropped and no longer required. Whether HUD contacted Longbridge Financial or not to advise them that this was an illegal request is not known. We just know they no longer required this change. 

12. I then called the Repair Department again, to ensure all my documents, receipts and invoices were recieved as well as the HUD Inspectors report. I was advised that yes, everything on my end was fulfilled and I do not need to do anything else. I was advised that once "" Upper Management '' reviewed the paperwork, the funds withheld would be released for my withdrawl and would take about a week to review and a week to recieve the funds. This Operator Confirmed that ALL REQUIRED DOCUMENTS HAD BEEN RECEIVED and were in review by management. 

XXXX. However, on XX/XX/2022, a letter went out to me, which I recieved on XX/XX/2022 stating that although the HUD Inspector 's report was received, that XXXX had not yet received the "" Contractor Affidavit And Conditional Waiver of Lien '' or any final invoices and/or reciepts are required to release the withheld funds on my account.

14. I again called the Repairs Department and got the same rude customer service rep I had conferenced with myself and the HUD inspector. She tried to say that this letter was sent out before they had received my documents or the inspectors report. This ... Made NO SENSE AT ALL!

15. I explained that I was told that a HUD Inspection was required, but would not be scheduled until all the required paperwork was submitted ( Reciepts/Invoices/Waiver of Lien ). Which was WHY I received call from Longbridge about scheduling out the inspector, NO NO NO! If I had not submitted my invoices, lien waiver, receipts, Longbridge would not have sent the HUD Inspectore out to my home to submit his report! 

16. The operator asked me to hold, and hung up on me!

17. I decided to check my account on their website, and it does not reflect that {$7600.00} is being held on my account for repairs. Yes, there is a place on the web page that has a box showing money being held for repairs. It shows a {$0.00} balance. 

18. This company 's web site does not provide any contact information to reach management, supervisors or anyone higher than a generic repair call center. 

19. I contacted their XXXX 's XXXX XXXX only to be told that I would have to contact someone from the Repair Department to resolve my issue. They did not have any phone numbers to contact management within that department. 

20. I emailed the company over and over and over again, asking that someone from management call me directly, and only receive a robotic reply saying that Someone would get back to me, that phone call never ever came! 

21. With my frustration getting out of control, I called the FHA Assistance line and spoke with a FHA Rep. I opened a claim, received a refence number XXXX, and a case number XXXX. 

I am EXTREMELY concerned that not only has this company taken funds from the cash out loan on my home to which they have no intention of returning to my Equity Line of Credit, but also that this company has the ability to damage my credit score and credit reports. 

I have complied with every single requirement to have the {$7600.00} retured to me, only to get so many false answers, or facts of what is happening and what is the problem that I can't get a part of the {$12000.00} that I paid to tile my entire home. 

I have been waiting for over 2-3 weeks for someone to contact me to resolve or clarify the issues preventing them from releasing funds that their web site isn ; t there. And if not being withheld for repairs, where IS IT??? 

I hope your agency can get involved and assist me in recovering money that Longbridge should have released three weeks ago or longer..

5957782,09/08/22,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Incorrect information on your report,"To Whom It May Concern ; I have made numerous attempts to provide XXXX, TransUnion and XXXX with government documents in the form ( s ) of various XXXX Department Police reports which have included a criminal police report case number XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX where I was identified as victim # 4 on page 2 as a person who's identity was stolen and used. I have also provided all 3 CRA 's an identity theft police report case number XXXX, a Financial Crimes police report, number, case XXXX dated XX/XX/XXXX and an FTC Identity Theft report number XXXX in regards to criminal fraudulent use of my personal information. 

I have disputed and sent all of the above police and FTC reports on numerous occasions in XXXX & XXXX of XXXX, in XXXX and again in XXXX. Yet, All 3 CRA 's continue to report fraudulent information on credit file which is in total violation as my consumer rights in the state of California. When any of the three CRA 's are asked how they verified the fraudulent information, I'm always told that the creditor verified that the account ( s ) belong to me.

If any of the 3 CRA 's attempted to verify any of the police/FTC reports provided to them, they would indeed find that my claims are true and that I was in fact contacted by my local police department about several crimes committed by the two individuals that were arrested.

It is my full belief that all 3 CRA 's are negligent in properly verifying these fraudulent accounts and considering that the creditors in question who continuously furnish fraudulent information to the CRA 's are paying customers, their word over my proof is enough to allow these creditors to continue to damage my credit and cause me harm. 

There is literally nothing left for me to do as a resident of California that is required under the FCRA in my state of residence that would offer me any comfort in trusting the information provided by the 3 CRA 's in protecting my personal and private information. Their continued abuse of my personal credit information is appalling and disgraceful and has caused me irreparable harm. 

Just recently, I have been applying for a new housing rental and have been told that I have to pay twice the amount of a security deposit to secure the rental. That's {$8200.00} USD to pay as a security deposit instead of {$4100.00} that I would qualify for if it weren't for the fraudulent accounts that the XXXX CRA 's are allowing to report on my credit file. I have been charged a higher interest fee for buying a car due to their irresponsibility. This is just a snippet of what their actions have caused me for the last 2 years. 

My wife was also a victim of this identity theft ring. As a matter of fact, my entire household was victimized by these two criminals. There were also several other victims named in the XXXX Police Departments Criminal case. My wife was able to get all of the fraudulent accounts removed and blocked from her credit file, while I was made to suffer for something that I had absolutely nothing to do with. Although I provided all three CRA 's with ample information to assist them in their investigations, it quickly became apparent to me that they could all care less about the accurate reporting of my personal credit information. 

The fraudulent accounts included companies such as XXXX XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and their collectors and a multitude of other fraudulent accounts opened at large corporations. I have been damaged over {$80000.00} in the fraudulent opening of accounts. My personal bank account was harmed in this fraud as well as it was literally drained at one point in time and I provided proof to all 3 CRA 's of this fraudulent activity. I am lucky that my local police department was able to catch the thieves and put a stop to their madness by locking them up. However, I can't say the same for any of the 3 CRA 's as they have facilitated the creditors in literally ruining what once was a great credit profile.

I kindly ask that you make the 3 CRA 's answer for why they have allowed fraudulent accounts to remain on my credit file by not removing or blocking the reported fraud from making its way into my credit file and damaging my good credit. I also kindly ask that you make them take action in removing the reported fraudulent accounts followed by blocking the creditor from ever reporting the fraud to the CRA again. My rights have been cosistently violated by XXXX, TransUnion and XXXX for the last XXXX years and it must stop. 

All police/FTC reports are verifiable and there are detectives ready to confirm what happened as is stated in the reports that I have provided to all 3 CRA 's . The accounts that I have been fighting to remove are as follows : XXXX. XXXX XXXX  XXXX Account - XXXX or XXXX ( transferred ) No action taken by the company XXXX- {$50000.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX Account - XXXX ( closed ) No action taken by the company XXXX- {$8600.00} XXXX. XXXX XXXX ( closed ) No action taken by the company Account - XXXX Amount {$12000.00} XXXX and TransUnion are by far the worst offenders. XXXX seems to have removed all fraudulent accounts except for the XXXX Bank account. XXXX is even listing addresses and phone numbers that don't belong to me. 

In closing all I would like to happen is that my credit be restored to the condition it was in prior to the fraudulent activity that I have proven does not belong to me. I have complied with everything asked of me by the creditors and the 3 CRA 's yet I get nothing in return but a fake credit file full of crimes not committed by me. All I ask is that these companies simply comply with my state law along with the FCRA rules and regulations. 

Thank you for your time and understanding. Hopefully together we can put this all behind us and carry on. 

At least the culprits are in jail.

The following events are in chronicle order as they occurred. 

On XX/XX/22. I called My Vanilla customer service phone number to report my card lost and to receive a replacement ASAP. The representative I spoke to stated that I will be receiving the card replacement w/in 5-7 business days by mail. In addition, there is a {$6.00} fee for a replacement card that will be deducted from my remaining cash balance. 

On XX/XX/22. I called My Vanilla customer service phone number, as a follow-up to inquire why I have not received my replacement card by now. The representative named XXXX. Stated the replacement card was "" mailed out to my address on XX/XX/22 ''. He stated I've should have received it, however, to allow a little more time to arrive. Nothing more he could do and rudely hung up. Totally disrespectful and unprofessional and after more than an HOUR wait time to even speak with anyone. 

On XX/XX/22. I again called My Vanilla customer service phone number to complain about this matter and that they have exceeded the time frame, that the representative on XX/XX/22 originally stated to me in receiving my replacement card, w/my remaining cash funds on my account for me to have access and use. I spoke to a supervisor named XXXX. Whom you will see was of NO help. I explained the history in detail, as I've indicated above, to XXXX. She then proceeded to make up stories as she went along all during our conversation. She stated all the previous rep 's I spoke to were '' incorrect '' when they informed me it would take only 5-7 business days to receive my replacement card. XXXX stated it's "" actually '' 7-10 business days, then changed even those days again, to 10-12 business days. Never could state a clear. accurate and honest answer. Multiple times, she would be muting me and going silent while I was speaking and asking her "" hello are you still there ''? Extremely rude and dishonest conduct on XXXX part. XXXX refused to compensate and work with me to rectify this ongoing issue, due to the long and unreasonable continuous waiting time of my card not arriving at this time. I requested she expedite via overnight express my replacement card to show a good faith effort to make for all that I've been experiencing by this business and due to the fact that I have financial obligations i.e. personal bills and rent to pay that are past due. Therefore, I need my prepaid card w/my funds still on it immediately, I stated to her. XXXX declined my request. She stated I will need to continue to wait more days until the "" card arrives, as it's on the way ''. I advised XXXX that this business is in breach of our agreement/terms. I received NO consideration nor empathy from this horrible supervisor, XXXX. 

I believe this business is maliciously, unduly, and deliberately w/out a valid cause, withholding and blocking access to my prepaid debit visa card funds I previously reloaded on my account.

5946286,09/04/22,Checking or savings account,Managing an account,"Summary of Prior Complaint # 1 ( XXXX ) : On XX/XX/2022, the Executive Office ( EO ) in XXXX, OH responded to my initial complaint. In that letter from the XXXX XXXX Chase Bank stated, that Chase has a goal to give the consumer "" exceptional service, and we are sorry if we fell short when you contacted us ''. In that complaint I reminded chase that on XX/XX/XXXX, I told your representative to "" stop accepting reversal of charges this is a fraud and scam issue. '' After that conversation Chase did not follow my instructions but instead continued taking "" reversal of charges '' totaling over {$15000.00}. At the time when unusual activity was being conducted on my account all Chase needed to do was to contact XXXX or myself and the scam would have never occurred. Thank you for attempting to make refunds to those business effected by the scam. 
Complaint # 2 : Thank you for your letter but Chase is continuing to fall short of providing "" exceptional service '' to me the consumer. Your Chase representatives from "" customer service '' and "" fraud department '' has implied that I took the money and used for my own purposes. With no regards to the fact that I am a victim of both scam and identity theft. All of this could have been stopped if Chase had made one phone call. The responses of your representatives simply re victimized me. Here once again the victim of a crime is made to feel like he is a criminal. Chase representative have continued to blame me for the incident. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I requested Chase not to accept my direct deposit from my pension totaling {$3500.00}. I then requested that it be sent back to the sender. I explain the circumstances having to do with the fraud and scam that was being investigated. Chase fraud department and customer service said they did not have the authority to return my pension of {$3500.00}. Because I needed to pay back the overdraft on my account. I was under the impression that notes were posted on my account that explained that a scam and fraud investigation was being conducted on this account. Someone in the fraud department should have been able to read and known what I was saying was true and the case was being investigated. I begged your representative to understand that this is all the money I have, and I need to pay rent and food. They did apologize but due to there being a large overdraft that they were within their rights to recover the money. 
After that conversation I felt defeated. Then on XX/XX/XXXX, I got a phone call from XXXX my X-partner that Chase went into his independent bank account without permission and took {$1900.00}. that was ear marked for his fall tuition. Once again, your actions violated the trust of the consumer. Opening a new account represents an act of trust. You never expect your bank to violate that trust. Now Chase is in the role of victimizing another person to who was not involved in the scam at all. 
Resolution to this Complaint : Return my pension of {$3500.00}. and send it to me as a "" cashiers check '' as soon as possible. Please put the {$1900.00}. back into XXXX 's account. He is a totally innocent person, and he was never involved. Please do the right thing. 
Sincerely XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.

These 14 purchases amounted to a total of {$780.00}, which we would never, intentionally, spend on a mobile game. Our USAA Debit card is setup on the XXXX XXXX XXXX so we can pay for several subscriptions and any other services. Unfortunately, we did not configure the security features in XXXX XXXX XXXX to ask for authorization, typically a fingerprint or password, before any manual purchase is made, since the owner of the phone is an adult. The family member who unintendingly made the purchases, fell asleep with the mobile game running, and part of her arm was touching the screen, which touched the coin package purchase button within the game, which is readily accessible, several times, and since there were now purchase authorization prompts, they went right through. I only noticed once I started receiving notifications on my phone about all the transaction taking place in succession. When I went to ask my family member about it, I noticed she was asleep and what was happening with her phone and mobile game. 

Immediately on that same day, we reached out to XXXX to try and have the transactions cancelled and refunded. We submitted the information they asked for on their XXXX XXXX refunds website while we chatted with a XXXX representative online. I also sent an email to the developer of the mobile game ( XXXX XXXX ), and they told us they can't process refunds and that we would have to do it through XXXX. The same day, XX/XX/2022, we called USAA and explained how these unintentional purchases happened, and they opened a dispute case. A day later, USAA refunded all the 14 purchases, which amounted to {$780.00}. 

Fast forward to XX/XX/2022, we noticed a charge from USAA that was not expected by us. I saw that this charge was a dispute credit reversal, which was for one of the unintentional purchases made back on XX/XX/2022. I called USAA 's customer support number and asked about the unannounced {$99.00} charge they made. When I asked more details about the charge and dispute, I was told that they found no errors in the transactions mentioned in the dispute and therefor, the amount they had refunded to us was going to be removed from my account within a week, which is XX/XX/2022. We asked for the dispute to be reviewed and that we did not agree with the final decision. I also explained what happened again and made sure they added the notes to the dispute in case it was not clear. 

No matter how much I tried and explained what happened, they said that they will still remove {$780.00} from my account. It didn't matter that the final decision is being reviewed, they will still take the money out of our account. I asked if there was anybody in USAA, a manager, director, anybody I could talk to, but I was told there wasn't anybody and that the person reviewing the dispute doesn't take direct calls. I was told a decision on the review will be communicated to us between 5-10 days. 

Interestingly, right after talking to USAA, we talked to a XXXX representative today, XX/XX/2022, and explained what had transpired with USAA. XXXX told us that they see all the 14 transactions as cancelled and that USAA shouldn't have processed any charges to our account.

Thank you in advance for all the help that you can provide me with. Thank you God Bless Please see attached. 


Finance of America XX/XX/XXXX REVERSE XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I am faxing you the document that started my loan. Please check on the interest rate and even the loan principal balance. 

If you recall our discussion and my request, at the time around XX/XX/XXXX, I stated that I would like to refinance out of the existing loan with XXXX XXXX to get a better FIXED interest rate and you agreed to help with that and XXXX XXXX, broker, was my witness. 

We were supposed to start this loan with 4.550 % ( see document ), then it was pushed to 5.00 % because of all the extensions of time that the loan took and the unreliable help from Finance of America due to XXXX that some transactions took to complete. It was a very slow frustrating process to have the process going. All the way to the end before closing, we were discussing 5.375 % Fixed Loan only. 

The loan took over a year to close. During the time, we had ups and downs with Finance of America employees. Due to XXXX, short on staff help, transactions took extra time to be taken care of and attended to! 

Then, it was very difficult to deal with the escrow agent XXXX XXXX to the point of ignoring phone calls and emails. XXXX XXXX, My Mortgage broker, had a lot of issues with XXXX XXXX to the point, he was refusing to communicate with him. Then, I was asked by XXXX XXXX to communicate with XXXX and he was unwilling to talk! The only time I have heard from XXXX was in the end after I called him numerous times and emailed him a few times to communicate with me. 

I received a phone call from XXXX XXXX telling me that he is changing the loan to a jumbo loan and he has to change the account number and the interest rate might be a little bit higher up to 5.5 %. You and XXXX XXXX never said or mentioned that he is going to change the structure of the loan from a fixed loan to anything other type of loan. 

Unfortunately, XXXX XXXX changed the loan structure without the client 's approval and knowledge. ( This is against the law ). Real Estate disclosures ( TILA-RESPA ) are a must in this situation and XXXX XXXX ignored the law and proceeded with closing with a loan that has been altered to fit his ego and time schedule to exit from Finance of America to his new hired job with a different company. 

This loan started in XX/XX/XXXX and closed in XX/XX/XXXX. You ( XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX had ample time to send me the loan disclosure to have my consent and approval. However, NO one had the decency and the professionalism to respect the law and forward me the disclosures based on TILA-RESPA. 

The loan structure was altered and changed from fixed to arm based on the recent document that you sent me in XXXX of XXXX. XXXX XXXX left the documents behind and rushed to his new position. However, before sending these documents to the notary to be signed, nobody checked on the documents for any accuracy, changes or mistakes!!, nor did I receive a copy to review before signinig! ( I believe this is sort of payback against you for whatever is between both of you ). 

At the time of signing with the notary, nobody advised me that the loan was changed. I was under the assumption and impression that everything was still the same! Everything was rushed in the end to close the loan with the impression the loan is still the same and there were NO changes. We had difficulties finding a notary that services homes. It was very difficult for us to accept a stranger into our home because of XXXX infections. The signing session was fast to limit our exposure to a stranger in our home. When we proceeded with the signing, the notary told me at that time you are getting about a 5.5 % interest rate, which is great. With that assumption, I proceeded with the signing! 

Unfortunately, I am not a mortgage officer and I do not have much knowledge about loans. I am a regular citizen and I go with whatever the professionals say and promise. Mortgage brokers have fiduciary duties like trust, loyalty, accounting and disclosures to the client which in this case was omitted and ignored. 

With all the alteration of the loan #, interest rate and structure, the different charges that were tagged to the loan? The loan balance as of today is close to a XXXX dollars from $ XXXX. In less than two years, This is OUTRAGOUS. Alteration of documents without disclosing the facts is against the law and it is considered FRAUD ''. 

There is definitely something not right in the loan documents and someone should be held accountable to all these changes without client 's knowledge, approval and full disclosures. Specially, from the beginning of this loan my request was A FIXED RATE LOAN. 

So basically, 1-The loan took one year to close 2- Finance of America was short handed because of XXXX and was very difficult to proceed. 
3- I was never informed about any changes.

4- I was never given the chance to examine or approve any document before signing.

5- Loan disclosures were omitted and were never given to me.

6- TILA-RESPA disclosures were never honored and exercised, avoiding and ignoring the law. 
7- Loan documents were altered and changed without my knowledge and approval.

8- I believe a FRAUD was committed in this situation.

9- Someone should be held accountable for all these alterations and fraudulent activities.

10- The law should not be ignored and avoided.

11- NO DISCLOSURES WHATSOEVER. THAT IS ILLEGAL.

12- I was SCAMMED!! My mortgage broker led me to believe that I am getting a 5.5 % fixed Interest rate! However, all these months from the closing of the loan my interest rate was Showing around 5.5 % interest till the month of XXXX of XXXX, my interest rate changed to. 
6.98 %. I called finance of America to get the details and no one would give me the correct Information then, I called my mortgage broker and asked him to supply me with the missing Information and to my surprise, the loan is an arm adjustable loan that caps at 10.565 %. 
This is CRIMINAL. 
13- To my understanding, this type of loan is protected under the HOME SAFE program. My Wife and I went thru counseling for the Home Safe and the Senior citizen protection to Assure us that we are getting the protection that is provided under the law for the Senior Citizens. Protection from scams, fraud and to get in good faith an honest loan estimate and In good faith disclosures. 

UNFORTUNATELY, WE ( My wife and I ) DID NOT GET ANY OF THE TOP, WE WERE LEFT IN THE DARK! IT WAS A TOTAL DISAPPOINTMENT AND FRAUD. 


14- We have been scammed! This is a crime under the law. Finance of America should be Stopped and held accountable for all the illegal alterations and changes without the client Approval. They should know that there is something called loan disclosures that they have To provide, not ignore and not commit illegal activities. 

! 5- I started this loan at the right time and interest rates were low! Now, interest rates are high And I am getting pinned with this fluctuating high interest rate because of the loan mortgage Officer negligence and alteration of the documents to fit their agenda. This is illegal. 

16- I can not imagine that during the worst days of the United States of America XXXX during The Coronavirus infections, infecting and killing thousands of people, layoff from jobs and The total chaos that we passed through and still going through! Someone had the courage And will to cheat and take advantage of vulnerable senior citizens, scam and fraud them. 
This is considered a crime and it is NOT LEGAL AND IT IS PUNISHABLE BY LAW..

***PS : Please see attached. 

Please, I am seeking your help and guidance in this matter. My loan monthly payments are going over the roof and I can not handle these outragous payments, I CAN NOT BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES OF SOMEONES BAD INTENTION BY IGNORING THE LAW, ALTERING DOCUMENTS AND AVOIDING THE LOAN DISCLOSURES. 

I believe FINANCE OF AMERICA should bear the consiquences and correct the mistake. I will not accept any fluctuations in my interest rate due to the fact from the begining, I asked for a FIXED RATE, EVEN AT THE END BEFORE CLOSING WE WERE DISCUSSING FIXED RATE AT 5.375 %. 

** Why should I refinance from a Fixed 6.5 % to this outragous loan. It does not make any sence! 

** The rules of the reverse mortgage! The client can refinance again within a six month or a year if the new loan shows a benefit to the client and is a better loan than the previous one. 

I am very disappointed and angry with Finance of America for allowing anyone to participate in this type of malicious acts and fraudulent avtivities specially, with all the problems and fraud we had in the year XXXX and XXXX with the mortgage industry. We did not learn and someone is still going around the bush to take advantage of the public and especially senior citizens. This situation is against the law and should be punishable by law and it should be corrected. 

It is a big burden on my finances and my health. XXXX of XXXX should not take any advantage of senior citizens. It is NOT Ethical or legal to place anyone in this situation just to make extra income or funds. IT IS JUST TOTAL GREED. 

*** I am reaching out to you to resolve this problem peacefully. I certainly do not want to seek any legal action against Finance of America yet! 

*** I am still hoping that this issue can be resolved within Finance Of America and the proper government entities can intervene to protect the Citizens and enforce the law. 

Looking forward to hearing your response and recommendation!

A few days after mailing, I saw the $ XXXX check go through my account. A couple days later, the $ XXXX check went through. I assumed this was my landlord depositing the checks until right after the $ XXXX check went through, she reached out inquiring where the rent was. I quickly learned that someone had stolen the envelope out of the mail and had cashed 2 of the 3 checks successfully. I called Wells Fargo immediately and began a claim. They put a stop payment on the $ XXXX check that had not been cashed yet and opened an investigation. They told me I'd hear back from someone within 10 days and that I could see the funds back in my account before that time. I assumed they would return my funds and do their own thing to go after whoever had done this. I was wrong. 

I didn't hear from them for more than two weeks, with me calling twice during that period to try and escalate things. We're talking about $ XXXX in stolen money here. When I finally got someone assigned, Wells Fargos position was that they held no responsibility here and they would act on my behalf to try and recoup the money as a courtesy to me. A completely absurd position to hold given these circumstances. 

The check for $ XXXX was made out to XXXX XXXX as I mentioned. It was deposited into a Wells Fargo account under a different name, via a Wells Fargo ATM without any manipulation to the check. Wells Fargo and their ATM accepted a check for $ XXXX via the ATM, with a name that didn't match, and no endorsement on the back, and didn't put a hold or call to me to verify. The Wells Fargo claims person basically said there are no security measures in place for verifying checks via an ATM. If a piece of paper has a valid account and routing number, they debit the funds. Absurdity # 1. 

They returned those funds about 60 days from the start of this, even though the money was in their institution and they could clearly see that the account that had them had no relation to the check or me. 

The second successfully cashed check, for $ XXXX, was cashed in a XXXX XXXX XXXX. The payee was still XXXX XXXX, but someone successfully cashed the check by just signing some other name on the back as an endorsement. Again, no verification that this person cashing the check had any connection to the payee listed on the front. It would be like if I found a XXXX dollar check on the ground made out to XXXX XXXX and just signed my name on the back and got it cashed. What kind of ridiculous system is this? 

We're now over 4 months from the start of this, and I have not received my {$3000.00} back. Wells Fargo has said this is on XXXX  XXXX XXXX and XXXX have not answered their letter asking for the monies return. Wells has said there's nothing I can do to get involved and best they'll do is send another letter. Wells ultimately accepted this check, it should fall on them. If they have a claim against XXXX, that should have nothing to do with me. Wells Fargo provided me with a financial vehicle that they apparently do not stand behind, it's negligent at best for this product to exist. 

If this is really the level of security a check offers, checks are completely vulnerable to the dumbest of fraud and should not exist.",No,"All names, ages, legal representation, physical characteristics, military information, and medical conditions have been fully redacted or are not present in the complaint."

Union Bank has acted negligent in this matter and is vicariously responsible for the fraudulent actions of their employee, XXXX XXXX XXXX. Around XX/XX/XXXX I called Union Bank for a Mortgage loan on a loan for a condo in XXXX. The condo was part of a new community project that was underdevelopment. I was put in touch with XXXX XXXX, aka XXXX XXXX. XXXX XXXX proceeded to gather many supporting documents including bank statements, tax returns, financial assets, etc.. in preparation for my loan. She assured me that I would be receiving a fixed rate of 3 % for a 30 years term. The rate would be fixed for 60 days with an extension if needed for construction delays. During that time, XXXX convinced me to invest in Roth IRA, Sep IRA and also in a short term investment with XXXX XXXX DBA XXXX XXXX. I expressed to XXXX that I was not interested in investing but she assured me that the money with XXXX investment was not a true investment as it would only be in that account for 60 days but the interest would strengthen the loan application by showing more reserves. Since XXXX worked as a loan officer at a major bank I trusted her and thought she was guiding me in the right direction. XXXX was in weekly communication with the sales office for the community getting updates. Sometime in XXXX of XXXX, XXXX told me that since the community is not having enough sales my loan would not get approved. I was worried as I had a placed a deposit of {$82000.00} as earnest money. I then requested a denial letter from XXXX so that I could submit to the sales office for the return of my money. on the evening of XX/XX/XXXX XXXX emails me a denial letter that seemed to have come from Union Bank, however some of the information on the letter seemed questionable.

This has been an awful and horrifying experience. 

That said, dealing with Bank of America has made it that much worse for me and my family.

A police report of the second incident. 
A detective investigating the incident. Note living in XXXX XXXX, the DA is very reluctant to press charges because of leniency on crime ( this is well documented in the media ) Re-sending the fax after it wasnt received. 
Going into a B of A to talk to someone who after a call claimed the reason I was on the hook for payment was I stated I had credit card in my possession. 

On that point, the line B of A kept going back to was I had my credit card in my possession. The truth was, on the first theft, card number ending in XXXX, I did. Because you sent you two versions. You sent me one without asking XX/XX/XXXX. The other one was stolen. This was explained at least twice over the phone to a representative. See the email below. I had two versions of the card.

One with touch features, the other did not. I had one version ( actually still have it ) The other was stolen. 

The first time she stole itmy assumption was cyber fraud. There were a lot of reports in the media about it at the time. 


It wasnt until I got a note from you a few weeks later, on XXXX that I found out it was an in-person transition into a Target I never set foot in. 

A couple days later, it would happen again. But not only did it happen to me, it happened to my wife. See below the XXXX XXXX purchase matching a pattern of stolen gift cards. 


The second time it happened, we caught the women red-handed. I did not have possession of the card. I called at XXXX XXXX after I recognized I didnt have it, and while I called she had indeed stolen it. 

Attached is photographic evidence. Heres the alternative charge that I made. Also, heres photos I took at the game, timestamped. If you KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT XXXX XXXX, you know its virtually impossible to get from XXXX XXXX  to XXXX XXXX in the time. 


At minimum, see this photo. There is a time stamp, a receipt, and her on camera with the card showing. Clearly, its not me, and its charged to my credit card. Its indisputable. 


On the XXXX charges the next day I went to XXXX, and it was confirmed by the manager that my former nanny used my card to buy XXXX gift cards. XXXX has a policy they wont let customers look at surveillance videos.

There was also a third call required before I finally received my card but I do not remember the dates and details of this call ( I do know it occurred prior to XX/XX/XXXX ). While trying to resolve this matter, I found out that they did not even have records of all conversations I had with representatives.

He needed help and didn't have a phone. He said he needed to make a phone call. I agreed to let him make a phone call. 

He took the phone from my hands and called somebody. He told me he was locked out of his apartmentXXXX and need to call his sister and/or XXXX host to get into the building. 

While he is holding my phone, he hacked and/or gained unauthorized entry into my Chase Mobile banking app without my knowledge or consent. He then sent himself or someone he knew an unauthorized XXXX payment from my account in the amount of {$5000.00}. The XXXX payment was sent to a user "" XXXX XXXX ''. I do not know this person/user. Again, this transaction was not authorized by me nor did I have any knowledge that it was happening. I was not holding my phone when this unauthorized transaction was made. I did not press any buttons or keys to initiate the sending or receiving of this transaction. 

When I got my phone back, I learned that this individual had uninstalled my Chase Banking app from my phone during the time he was holding my phone. This I assume was to slow down my response time in noticing the fraud had taken place. 

I called Chase immediately and reported the fraudulent, unauthorized transaction. I also filed a fraud claim with Chase to get my {$5000.00} returned. I had Chase put a freeze on all my accounts. I went into my local Chase branch the next morning and relayed the information about the unauthorized transaction, fraud, and identity theft. It can be corroborated there with the individual ( s ) that helped me. I closed my accounts out of an abundance of caution, as this individual had access to sensitive financial and personal information when inside my banking app and phone. I opened all new accounts with Chase and I also filed a police report with my local police department. I have attached the police report. 

On XX/XX/2022 I called Chase to get an update on my fraud claim. They informed me that they had chosen to deny my claim and that they believe no fraud had taken place. This assessment of my claim is false. I was the victim of fraud. I never willingly gave anyone access to my XXXX chase, or other financial accounts. I have read and understand the Electronic Fund Transfers Act and Regulation E.

On XX/XX/XXXX I went to use this debit card to withdraw {$1000.00} from the ATM at the Bank of America ATM on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX in XXXX CA. The ATM denied the withdrawal saying I had reached my maximum withdrawal for the day, however, I never went to the bank that day. I called the Bank of America customer service number on the back of my card and they said there were ten {$1000.00} withdrawals, one a day, for the past 10 days. As soon as I realized my money was being stolen on XX/XX/XXXX, I called Bank of America Prepaid Claims to cancel that debit card and send me a new card. I have not used the new card and I cut up the old card. 

I filed a fraud claim with Bank of America on XX/XX/XXXX. I included the following transactions. 
XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : {$1000.00} withdrawal XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX 24 minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal 30 seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal Then Bank of America rejected my claim because they said I made the withdrawal at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. After looking into it, I realized the agent and myself made a mistake by including two transactions that I had actually made. I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX and I made the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX. I asked Bank of America to remove the two withdrawals I made on those dates and to send in a reconsideration of the claim with those two withdrawal transactions removed. Bank of America said the removal of the two transactions were approved and removed from the claim, however, Bank of America still kept denying the claim. 

The following transactions are definitely fraud and I have been trying to dispute them for since XX/XX/XXXX to get the {$8000.00} from me that was stolen : XX/XX/XXXX : balance inquiry : XXXX Withdrawal time : XXXX $ XXXX Again on XX/XX/XXXX : transaction date XXXX $ XXXX, but it posted on on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX ( 6 mins minutes after XXXX  ) XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX $ XXXX withdrawal, posted on XX/XX/XXXX XXXX minutes after XXXX  XX/XX/XXXX : transaction at XXXX XXXX posted on XXXX ( me ) Bal inquiry at XXXX and XXXX withdrawal was on XX/XX/XXXX posted at XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX XX/XX/XXXX : XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  posted on same date XXXX : bal inquiry at XXXX ( 44 mins after XXXX  ), withdrawal of XXXX at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX at XXXX seconds and then ATM $ XXXX withdrawal XXXX seconds later at XXXX seconds XXXX  XXXX : inquiry at XXXX XXXX  and $ XXXX withdrawal at XXXX XXXX  XXXX : XXXX XXXX  $ XXXX withdrawal There were eight total {$1000.00} withdrawals that I did not do which are fraud. 

On XXXX XXXX I filed a police report with the City of XXXX. The police report number is : XXXX and the officer is XXXX # XXXX. Currently, Detective XXXX of the XXXX Police Department is working on my case to press criminal charges against the person who committed fraud against me. When I spoke to Detective XXXX yesterday on XX/XX/XXXX, She informed me that she spoke with Bank of America and they told her the footage is now deleted as it expires after 120 days. However, I believe Bank of America is lying that they no longer have the footage because they mailed me a still capture image of myself at the ATM from XX/XX/XXXX and they mailed that to me on XX/XX/XXXX, which is way past 120 days. Now Bank of America is lying to the police. 

I feel like Bank of America has been pushing me around in a circle and now the footage that proves my innocence to get my money back is "" erased '', according to Bank of America. 

I request the {$8000.00} stolen from me is returned. I have filed numerous complaints to Bank of America against agents who misled me during the claim process and against agents who said they did something that they did not actually do. I.E. removing the two transactions that were me. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX a supervisor who said their team working on my claim will review all the footage. That never happened. 
On XX/XX/XXXX the claim was denied again because XXXX, a supervisor in Kansas said they were only looking at the two videos of me, and they had not looked at any additional footage from the other dates that I was disputing since the first video showed me at the ATM on XX/XX/XXXX. She said she requested for the transaction on XX/XX/XXXX to be removed. She also said the withdrawal on XX/XX/XXXX was removed from the claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX, a Bank of America agent from Georgia. She said she did a withdrawal to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction and sent in a request to escalate it. This was contradictory to what XXXX told me, because she said the XX/XX/XXXX transaction was already removed, but this other agent said it was not. XXXX said she also did not see a letter generated to remove the XX/XX/XXXX transaction, so she submitted a request to remove that transaction from the claim. She also filed three complaints against agents who did not properly file the removal of transactions and she claims that she escalated those complaints. My claim was still getting denied. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to XXXX in Alabama. She submitted a reconsideration request of my claim. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with XXXX in Nevada. I told her that in the mail, I received still captures of two transactions that I did. One on XX/XX/XXXX ( which was not included in the claim ) and one from XX/XX/XXXX. I asked her why Bank of America won't send me the footage/still captures of the other eight ATM withdrawals that I know were not me. She said since Bank of America identified me in the transaction from XX/XX/XXXX, they didn't look at anymore footage, they just denied the whole claim. She also confirmed that the two transactions on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX were finally removed and excluded from the claim. However, If this was truly the case, I don't know why the claim would still get denied when the other 8 transactions will not show me because I was never at the bank in the wee hours of the morning when those 8 transactions took place. XXXX also submitted a request to have the images of the other 8 transactions mailed to me. I was waiting over two weeks for these images but I never received anything in the mail. 
On XX/XX/XXXX I spoke to supervisor XXXX in Texas. He submitted another reconsideration request and he recommended I write another letter to Bank of America explaining the situation. I submitted another detailed letter to them via fax and still have heard nothing back. According to Agent XXXX, there are still attempted transactions being made on the old card even up to XX/XX/XXXX. 

I called the OCC and State Banking Regulator of CA. They recommended I file a complaint here. 

Bank of America, to my knowledge, never reviewed all the tapes of the transactions that were in this claim. 

Overall, the patterns of these fraudulent transactions do not align with my behaviors using the debit card and I know the footage of the eight withdrawals I am contesting will show the person making those withdrawals, I solemnly swear is not me, XXXX XXXX XXXX. I have also been a loyal Bank of America customer for personal checking accounts since XXXX and my current business accounts are also with Bank of America since XXXX.",Yes,"this redacted complaint still contains personal information.

I thought the price was reasonable and since the seller provided multiple pictures of the camera, and even a picture of the serial number upon my request, I thought that the seller was selling a legit camera. The seller then asked me if I can pay with XXXX. Being my first time using XXXX XXXX  and since I used XXXX in the past, I didn't think it was something concerning at first. 

After exchanging basic information such as shipping address and name, I sent {$200.00} to the XXXX  account, with a shipping fee of {$45.00} to the account the seller specified. Immediately, I got a text saying that the XXXX  transaction was "" declined '' ( Later I realized that they spoofed a Bank of America no-reply phone number and the transactions were never declined in my bank account. Hence the quotes ). I then tried sending the same amount to another account the seller specified. For some reason, only part of the fees went through and the other part was "" declined ''. The seller also tricked me by refunding some fees back, acting like he wasn't scamming me. 

After a series of back and forth transactions, the seller wanted me to transfer through paypal. At this point, I already knew I was scammed. To put it to the test, I intentionally transferred the amount through the seller method in paypal, which had buyer protection ( I got my money back from paypal, but not from XXXX/BoA ). The scammer kept saying that he will refund more money if I give him more which I already knew it was a lie and called him out for that. The seller then got very furious and we got into a heated conversation which further verifies that he is actually scamming me. In total, I was scammed {$530.00}. 

That afternoon, I called Bank of America immediately and described my situation. They filed my case and told me to wait for the results. On XX/XX/2022, I got a letter saying that they were unable to approve my recent claim and I had to wait another 45 days if they have any additional information ( document linked down below ).

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received another letter from Synchrony Bank, dated XX/XX/XXXX, denying my fraud claim because they said the account had been open for more than 12 months, and they said I had made a payment. The initial fraud was initiated online, and I was only made aware of it because of the past due bill I received in the mail in early XXXX of XXXX. I assume the payment they received was sent online by the person who opened this account. I HAVE NEVER HAD AN ONLINE PAY PAL ACCOUNT, AND I DID NOT REQUEST OR EVER RECEIVE A PAY PAL CREDIT CARD.

I received a new PayPal credit card bill which shows a statement closing date of XX/XX/XXXX.

I enjoyed my time there, however I have XXXX kids, my son is now XXXX XXXX XXXX and my daughter is now XXXX XXXX XXXX and we have a dog so with my family getting older, dog getting bigger, I wanted to find a home where my kids have room to grow and enjoy friends over, so I decided to find a house and move out of an apartment. 
Over those XXXX years, I built a great partnership with XXXX XXXX in the leasing office as she was XXXX of the people I met when I moved in. In my XXXX years there, I was never delinquent without letting them know ahead of time and paying all necessary fees. So when I went to the office on XX/XX/XXXX with my son, I talked to XXXX XXXX about a home we found and we were moving out and I wanted to make sure I followed the move out process. We completed a walk through inspection of my home but stated I needed to leave my keys and fob on the kitchen counter when I moved out on XX/XX/XXXX and because the apartment complex was changing from XXXX XXXX  XXXX to another company ( now is called the XXXX at XXXX ) I could leave without a fee but I was forfeiting my deposit. She even gave me a rental reference on my new home which I moved into on XX/XX/XXXX ( please see the attachment Tenant Rental Verification ). To ensure things were documented, I sent an email on XX/XX/XXXX and recapped the move out ( Please see email XXXX XXXX move out. 
I am not perfect by any means but I have been trying to purchase a home and I have been trying to maintain my credit, my bills and obligations for the last year, so I can afford my home. I have attached my credit report so you could see I am definitely trying. I found the home I was interested in purchasing and you can imagine to my surprise when I was denied due to XXXX at XXXX putting on my credit report an eviction and a balance of {$7900.00}. I had no prior balance ( please see a copy of the XXXX rent receipt and confirmation ) so I have no idea where this amount is coming from, secondly, I completed all the necessary steps and left on good terms, so how was this an eviction when I was already out of the apartment and they knew it so I was never properly served. Another thing to consider is why did they wait so long for the eviction if indeed they thought I was still there? Since I have been there for 3 years, they have all my contact information. Why wait almost 2 months before doing anything, when I have been paying rent on time? This was a deliberate act of sabotage towards me and my family. 
I immediately created an account with Equifax, XXXX and XXXX to see if this was on all my accounts and it was under XXXX at XXXX on Equifax, XXXX and XXXX had a collection agency called XXXX XXXX XXXX with their information representing the XXXX at XXXX ( Please see a copy of my credit report marked Collections document. ).

I have sent numerous dispute debt letters to Equifax, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX but none of the agencies have removed this off my credit report as a collection ( please reference the Debt Dispute Letters attached ). I sent the court documents so they could see this is indeed not in collections because the amount is wrong and I was not evicted. 
I went to court on XX/XX/XXXX and the Judge was XXXX XXXX and all sides presented, the Judge asked me to provide the figures of the true amount and present to the Plaintiff ( please see attached document called Settlement Stipulations ) and once I did submit they sent an email stating they did not agree ( please see email attached ) and there has been no further discussion since.

First violation : 15 U.S. Code 1681i : Transunion received my dispute letters sent via certified mail, and never followed the proper procedure upon disputed accuracy. I also never received the results of any alleged investigations, nor any physical documents baring my signature, nor did I even receive a copy of my credit report. Second violation : 15 U.S. Code 1681XXXX : It is prohibited to continue reporting information upon receiving notice by the consumer that the information being reported is believed to be incorrect by the consumer. Since my very first dispute a year ago, the information I disputed never ceased reporting. Third violation : 15 U.S. Code 1681XXXX ( a ) : The information was disputed as identity theft, and was never blocked within four ( 4 ) days of receipt.

No consent is identity theft! Congress states under 15 U.S. Code 1681 that credit reporting agencies are to exercise their grave responsibilities with fairness, impartiality, and respect the consumers right to privacy. I am being treated unfairly, and my right to privacy is NOT being protected! Especially by continuing to report this information. Furthermore, 15 U.S. Code 1681 ( XXXX ) states that transactions and experiences between the consumer and furnisher is to be "" excluded '' from consumer reporting. Again, I never consented to any of this! There are more violations, but I will stick to these for now. I informed Transunion of this previously, and all they did was list the disputed items through the CFPB portal as "" updated ''. It took two months ( 60 days ) for that lazy response! There is no way that any human interaction occurred! Speaking of, I never consented to XXXX, and do not consent to XXXX going forward.

Please stop undermining my public confidence in the banking system! The next one isn't a violation, but 15 U.S. Code 6801 refers to the protection of nonpublic personal information.

Financial institutions may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ANY nonpublic personal information, unless such financial institution provides or has provided to the consumer a notice. I, the consumer was never given an explanation of how I can exercise that nondisclosure option. I never provided consent or direction to any companies listed to share my information.

I came to the US, to the state California at the end of XXXX of XXXX as an immigrant. On XX/XX/XXXX, my social security which I barely had received was used in the state of Arizona inside of a Wells Fargo Branch to open a fraudulent account for an identity thief. The identity thief used my social security to open multiple accounts with Wells Fargo. They opened a business checking account, a credit card account. I discovered about this issue in XXXX because I never knew that these accounts existed. Since then I've contacted Wells Fargo and informed them that this is an identity theft case and I am not the holder of these accounts. I have never been to Arizona to open such an account and I did explain this to the Wells Fargo representatives over the phone. They told me they will take care of the issue and resolve it. However, I recently started to check again and Wells Fargo have not done anything. The accounts are still reporting. Therefore, I contacted them and informed them of the issue they keep telling me that I am responsible for the accounts. I informed them that these accounts were opened as a result of identity theft in the state of Arizona because I have never been to Arizona. So when I spoke with the representatives of the executive fraud team, I requested the original application that was used in the state of Arizona when opening these accounts. They had difficulties providing the document but they sent it to me and I will attach it in this report. The documents are Record of Application Information and Credit Card Application and Agreement. There is one thing that I did notice is that my signature was forged but not perfectly. I also informed the Wells Fargo executive fraud team supervisor, however, Wells Fargo does not conduct the proper procedures to remove and purge these accounts. I have never associated with Wells Fargo I informed them with that also. As a matter of fact, I never used a credit card in my entire life. Even now I do not use credit cards. They tried to investigate with me when they saw I my credit report that I had bought vehicles. I told them I buy my vehicle cash and leave 5 to 10 percent for payments so I can build a credit. My transactions are cash and nothing more. I only have a checking account with XXXX  XXXX XXXX and that is my only account. Under the Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX of financial crimes enforcement network paragraph ( a ) ( 2 ) ( i ) ( B ) and ( C ) the bank must follow the procedures of verifying the individual before opening any account for a consumer by verifying their name, date of birth, address of residency and check for a valid identification.

Wells Fargo opened and became accomplice in an identity theft when they opened the account in Arizona. Plus, Wells Fargo have a history of opening fraudulent accounts under consumer names illegally without their consent and authorization. Wells Fargo have a precedent in gaming practices against them. Whilst I understand that {$1400.00} might not be much however, the account is not mine because I never associated with Wells Fargo. I am not requesting another investigation to be conducted because Wells Fargo is a biased bank the record of application alone can serve as sufficient evidence that I was not the individual that opened the account. Per Wells Fargo 's claim the account was opened in XXXX, AZ at a branch with an individual present. However, I have never been to XXXX, AZ to this day and they can check the public records if I have ever set foot in AZ.

URGENCY : HIGH IMPORTANCE : HIGH [ WITHOUT PREJUDICE ] I wish to practice my right as a customer of Coinbase to use your organisation 's service, seeking a formal, impartial investigation to amicably settle my dispute with Coinbase. 
In order to clear up the myriad of letters and correspondences I have hitherto sent to Coinbase respecting my complaint, I believe it will substantially strengthen both my case and your understanding, by taking a deeper look at the happenings of my case and analysing the relevant facts in an objective and comprehensive fashion. 
It is crucial to note that I have been manipulated, socially engineered and coerced to engage these fraudulent criminals. Much to my embarrassment, I recognize that I am the victim of an investment scam. 
My complaint to the CFPB has arisen as I do not consider, by any stretch of the imagination, the conduct of Coinbase to be commensurate with their legal role and responsibility to their customers. They sell a service to look after their customers, protect their money and are a financial institution that maintains a traditional relationship and way of working with its customers. 
During the complaints process with Coinbase, I found their communication ineffective, which further hides their conduct to management and diminishes the service offering to their clients. They are struggling to adapt their business offering in the ever-changing world of IT development. The internet is presenting a real problem which they choose to manage in a way which is not in line with rules and regulations of CFPB as well as their own internal policy and procedures sold to their clients. 
General Obligation : Commencing on or around XXXX XXXX, 2022, I fell victim to a multi-layered scam operation run by XXXX which involved me making deposits for a total amount of XXXX XXXX from my Coinbase account to these fraudulent investment company. 
When determining whats reasonable and fair, we should focus on the issue of liability ; common queries include, but are not limited to, the following : ( i ) whether Coinbase did not take notice of any rule, law, or regulation, and/or possibly missed any material elements of the relevant bylaws or codes of conduct, that may have prevented them from protecting my financial safety ; ( ii ) whether by virtue of Coinbases custodianship over my funds or by its control over them, they owed a fiduciary duty to the me and if so, whether that duty was breached ; ( iii ) whether Coinbase promoted the transaction ( s ) in question despite being aware of the nature of the transaction ( s ) in question ( iv ) whether Coinbase was in compliance with its own policies and procedures ; ( v ) whether Coinbase owed duties to myself, what the scope of those duties was, and whether Coinbase did not uphold those duties ; ( vi ) whether Coinbases conduct was unfair ; and ( vii ) whether Coinbase has within its power the ability to, and should, compensate me for the harm that has befallen me. 
Upon identification of such unusual or suspicious activity, it is crucial that the relevant staff member adequately describe the factors making an activity or transaction suspicious, thoroughly depict the extent and nature of this activity and properly communicate to the customer that such activity meets the relevant criteria of fraud. 
In providing its services to a customer, a financial institution is required by law to exercise the care and skill of a diligent, prudent organization. In this case, this means that the payment service provider should not turn a XXXX eye to known facts pointing to a real possibility that their customer is being scammed. In other words, Coinbase must have had special knowledge of what was occurring or been alerted to a real possibility of fraud taking place. The financial institution must have known or reasonably ought to have known that I was dealing with a scammer. 
Granted, there is room for diversity of view insofar as reasonableness is concerned. Indeed, there is a sense in which the standard of care of the reasonable person involves in its application a subjective element. 
However, it must be remembered that the correct test is always reasonable care in all circumstances, not average care. The fact that most people behave in a certain way may be good evidence that the conduct is reasonable, but this is not necessarily the case. Although reasonableness is a very fluid concept, all of the evidence suggests that Coinbase did not foresee the fraud and disregarded even the most obvious dangers in this respect. 
Situations do tend to repeat themselves and it is advisable to examine previous outcomes to see how the standard of the reasonable person should be applied, and that lessons can be learnt from the errors of the past. 
Coinbases Position : Coinbase did not provide us with a response even if we sent out several letters to them. 
Refuting Coinbases arguments from a purely logical perspective : Coinbases position is that the features of the situation at hand do not generate a genuine obligation to protect innocent and helpless victims ; they are essentially arguing that common-sense-based approaches are doomed to fail, leaving their exclusively technical account of the subject matter as the only meaningful choice. For reasons which are unclear, this extremely serious situation barely gets the attention it deserves even though ample evidence has been offered in support of this complaint. 
In Coinbases view, it is implied that we should not home in ( and consequently rely ) on unwritten laws, practicality, good judgement, reasonableness, sharpness, sensibleness, past outcomes, and insight, when taking appropriate precautions. To underscore, once again, such views are at odds with common sense and are wildly irresponsible. 
Imagine a view according to which the one and only thing that can make Coinbase morally obligated to do something is having it written down somewhere. Pursuant to this view, if Coinbase encounter the suffering of totally naive victims, they are only obligated to intervene in or remedy the situation, to the degree required by written material. This is unbecoming for a reputable establishment such as Coinbase. 
I have reviewed the material hereto sent by Coinbase carefully, and it unfortunately provides no response to my fundamental argument concerning the degree of care. Given its size, influence, and the resources at its disposal, this establishment clearly had a far greater capacity than an individual such as myself had, to determine the level and likelihood of risk that a client such as myself is subjected to and had a duty to intervene as they now do to query in particular out-of-pattern transactions of this kind. 
It is perfectly obvious that Coinbase, inadvertently, employs a subtle approach in addressing some of the key questions in a manner which neither provides me with adequate support nor protects anything other than its own interests. 
It is Coinbase here, who has the burden of proof, to show that it has exercised the duty of care, that is to say, that Coinbase adhered to a standard of reasonable care in relation to the matter at issue given its extensive experience compared to mine. 
It is Coinbase that claims that the damages which I have suffered in connection to this matter have not been reasonably foreseeable, and that my proposed degree of care is not, and has not been, commensurate with Coinbases capacity, experience, expertise, or scope of services in any way. To reemphasize, Coinbases indisputable overriding purpose is by no means to purely execute transactions in a XXXX and blank fashion, but rather to strike a balance between executing those transactions and capitalizing on its undeniably vast capabilities to protect consumers thereby enhancing market integrity. 
Apropos of the fluidity of the concept of reasonableness, all Coinbase has done in this regard is set up a dichotomy of having or not having the legal obligation under consideration, however, that does not go one inch toward explaining why various regulatory authorities, such as the FCA, has maintained that financial institutions can, and should, protect consumers using their systems, advanced technologies, and rich experience. 
Coinbase is obliged to take some action if it is sufficiently aware of a real possibility that a fraud may be being perpetuated. 
If you don't question its customers instructions or raise the possibility of a scam with the customer in these circumstances, it may be liable if the red flags indicate the customer is : particularly vulnerable, or if the possibility of fraud was serious or real, not just suspected. 
There are some recommendations to organisations for protecting customers from financial harm that might occur as a result of fraud or financial abuse ; and gives guidance on how to recognise customers who might be at risk, how to assess the potential risks to the individual and how to take the necessary actions to prevent or minimise financial harm. 
These recommendations are established as a general principle, the organisation should deliver a service that : 1 ) Takes a proactive approach to minimising risks, impact and incidences of financial harm and it sets out systems and tools for the prevention and detection of fraud and financial abuse. As a general point, it says organisations should ensure that all systems are developed using technologies and methodologies that are effective in the prevention of fraud and financial abuse, through authorised and unauthorised payments, thereby minimising the risk of financial harm to customers. As regards to the detection of fraud and financial abuse, it says the organisation : A ) should have measures in place across all payment channels and products to detect suspicious transactions or activities that might indicate fraud or financial abuse. It then lists the following examples of suspicious activity on customer accounts : a. multiple cheque books; b. sudden increased spending ; c. transfers to other accounts ; d. multiple password attempts ; e. logins from new devices, multiple geographical locations ; f. sudden changes to the operation of the account ; Unusual transactions are transactions whose amount, characteristics and frequency bear no relation to the economic activity of the customer, exceed normal market parameters or have no apparent legal justification. 
g. a withdrawal or payment for a large amount ; h. a payment or series of payments to a new payee ; i. financial activity that matches a known method of fraud or financial abuse. 
B ) organisations should have a process in place to ensure that staff make contact with the customer to verify the financial activity, challenge its authenticity, explain the nature of the suspected or detected fraud and discuss an appropriate plan of action. 
Coinbase are yet to show, or otherwise provide me with, a compelling argument that their wide-ranging experience and wealth of specialist knowledge in detecting transactional anomalies were not sufficient to avert the fraud at issue. By contrast, I have provided a multitude of sound and powerful reasons by which requiring their involvement has not only been pressingly relevant but also eminently reasonable and well-justified. 
Rather than empathizing with and undertaking substantial efforts to convey their knowledge of the existence of such regulations abroad and thereafter use it to protect and proactively relieve the plight of consumers who have been cheated out of their money and whose role in society is properly fulfilled, positively contributing to local economic growth, development and sustainability Coinbase adopts a rather insouciant attitude toward my financial predicament portrayed herein. 
I am deeply convinced that the disastrous results that I have previously elaborated upon will continue to ensue if no responsibility is adopted by Coinbase in relation to this matter. I have also thoroughly detailed why they can not simply dismiss this problem by strictly adhering to legal technicalities which, after careful reflection, struck me as being nothing more than self-interest. Indeed, it seems to me utterly unfair to disregard fragile, sensitive, and vulnerable consumers who are afflicted by such allegedly malevolent acts, thereby keeping an unjust status-quo that is corrupting our society at its core. 
Conclusion : Based on my analysis, and as confirmed by various authorities concerned with such matters, there is abundant evidence that forward-thinking financial institutions ought to take reasonable steps to forestall fraud, or at least mitigate its risk by using an effective risk management system, demonstrating their undisputed ability to responsibly and pre-emptively respond to questionable transactions in the digital arena. The use of such systems, largely based on newly adopted technologies aimed at effectively navigating the evolving threat landscape, is only one of a number of possible endeavours undertaken in this connection, alongside the application of past knowledge and experience related to popular fraudulent practices. 
Astonishingly, I am pondering how it is that despite being shown that Coinbases business conduct was insufficient insofar as background checks are concerned, they keep refuting their indisputable role and responsibility in connection with the matter herein discussed. The points that I have hitherto made are too crucial to be taken lightly. Coinbases non-observance of the fundamental principles of justice that is, to completely overlook and not even remotely try to mitigate the suffering of vulnerable consumers is inexcusable given the size of the establishment and the vast resources at its disposal as the direct result of the patronage of clients like myself. 
If it was, indeed, solely my responsibility, we must then believe at least one of the following clauses : a ) financial institutions have absolutely no role whatsoever in preventing and detecting fraud, b ) the fraud in question was not reasonably foreseeable, or c ) the transactions in question were not sufficiently alarming. It is extremely unfortunate that Coinbase pushes quite hard for me to believe all three of these thingsdespite evidence to the contrary. 
In summary, I respectively ask your organization to consider my points, given your personal and companywide obligation to provide a fair and reasonable investigation into the complaint. 
I look forward to your input and would gladly cooperate to reach a fair and reasonable outcome. 
Thank you.

Each account is showing that I have 10 late payments, with a total of 90 late payments combined. They are showing on my credit report as negative accounts and it is heavily impacting me and my credit. I placed my loans on forbearance due to economic hardship and while my loans were on a forbearance status, my student loan company kept on reporting my payments as late payments to the credit bureau in XXXX, XXXX- ( 90 days late ), XXXX- ( 120 days late ), XXXX ( 120 days late ), XXXX ( 120 days late ), XXXX ( 120 days late ), and in XXXX XXXX- ( 120 days late ) and again in XXXX XXXX- ( 90 days late ), XXXX- ( 120 days late ), XXXX- ( 90 days late ), XXXX- ( 120 days late ). I placed my loans on forbearance a few times and each time I would do so, I would place my loans in forbearance status over the phone with a representative because I did not have immediate access to a fax machine or computer. I would also ask what I needed to do on my end to make sure I wouldn't fall into a negative status and their response was to continue to call back. 
Nel Net did correct some negative reports and I really appreciate what they did but after learning of the new negative reports, I am asking and begging Nel Net to please remove the negative reports off of my credit. It is really impacting me personally and mentally, there is a very high chance that I will need to move out of my curent home with my children and move into a relatives home because I can't afford to pay a high deposit rate due to my credit that is being impacted by the negative reports from Nel Net.

5960844,09/08/22,"Money transfer, virtual currency, or money service",Other transaction problem,"In 2021 I started an account with BlockFi, who provided interest bearing accounts on cryptocurrencies you deposit with them similar to savings accounts. They provide crypto wallet addresses specifically for the account holder to send the deposits to, and those wallets are maintained by a third party custodian, I believe either XXXX or XXXX are who they use for custodial services. 

Back in XXXX of XXXX, I deposited just short of {$10000.00} worth of the stablecoin XXXX  ( XXXX XXXX ) over a couple days to my deposit address they provided me for XXXX. At the time however, the deposit page they provided did not specifically say to only deposit the XXXX XXXX version of XXXX  ( XXXX ) to the address given to me. Since it did not specify that, I sent the XXXX XXXX XXXX  version of XXXX  ( XXXX ) which was made to be compatible with XXXX  XXXX wallet addresses. 

My deposits made it to my provided deposit wallet address successfully. I can see the transactions on the XXXX just fine when looking up the wallet address. My nearly {$10000.00} worth of XXXX is still sitting in that address untouched and safe, but since it wasn't sent in XXXX, they refuse to credit it to me and claim that it is lost money that they hold no liability for and can do nothing to recover it. 

That however is not true, and they simply just don't want to help recover it, and say they can't because the wallets belong to their third party custodian who provided them with the addresses they gave to me. Now when I try to contact the custodians about it, they won't even talk to me because I don't actually have an account with them, BlockFi does, yet BlockFi refuses to contact them on my behalf to remedy the situation. 

Fixing this can be done in a matter of a few minutes if they wanted to be cooperative and it can be done in 2 different ways ... the first way would be for BlockFi to ask their custodian maintaining my deposit wallet address, to provide me with the recovery passphrase key, so that I could import that wallet address into a wallet app on my phone like XXXX, so that I can have access to the contents of it and just send that XXXX  back to my wallet I had sent it from. 

The other simple way to fix it would be for the custodian to simply switch the network on the wallet from their app from the XXXX  network to the XXXX network, which can be done in less than minute, so that they can see the XXXX  that is being held by that address which isnt visible while on the XXXX network, and then just send that XXXX  back to the same address which it came from. Recently I even sent some XXXX to that wallet address, which would be needed to pay for the transaction fee to send that XXXX  back to me, just to make it a quick and hassle free process for them to take care of. 

I should point out that there have been multiple other people who have had the same exact problem here with BlockFi that I am having, sending XXXX XXXX  instead of XXXX XXXX and BlockFi was not willing to help them either and claim they hold no blame and did nothing wrong. However if that were true, then they wouldn't have had to later update the deposit address page to start specifying XXXX tokens only, which you can see in the photos I've attached. They changed it because after this happened to multiple people they realized they partially negligent by not being clear on the original page, and they wouldn't have needed to change it if they did no wrong. 

BlockFi pays a third party to provide and maintain these wallet addresses for them, to provide to us.. If part of their agreement dictates they can't be given the recovery keys by the custodian for the wallets to provide me with or can't have the custodian directly provide me with the keys to my deposit wallet address so that I could have access to recover my digital assets instantly, they can at least ask the custodian to simply open the wallet on the XXXX XXXX really quick, so they can see the XXXX in there, and just send it back to the same address it came from, using the XXXX I recently added to more than cover the transaction fee. It isn't some complex and impossible task like they claim.. but they insist on not helping and so for over a year, a large sum of valuable digital assets of mine have been sitting there, not collecting interest, and being held hostage from me which someone would eventually get to just pocket if I were to die or something.",No,

I understand there is information regarding these leads being sold by the major credit reporting agencies and somehow making it legal to do so. 
I also believe there is an underline issue with this.

Some claiming to be a partner of XXXX and just doing a follow up to make sure the client gets good service. I have an actual recording from a call. 

Do I tell my clients that there information is sold the minute they pull there own credit for a mortgage. it seems that if I am aware this happens then it makes me responsible to disclose the fact that this can happen and more than likely will happen but theres nothing I can do about it. Since the three major credit reporting agencies dont actually pull credit for consumers, they dont have any sort of permission to sell peoples information for profit.

This doesn't sit right with me, regardless of being legal or not it seems there should be some protection in the California privacy laws prohibiting this from happening to unsuspecting consumers.

The purposes of this, we all know, was that we could go green to protect our environment. Personally, for me, they promised that I could reduce my electrical bill by a very large percentage. Plus, there would be some tax benefit from the government. Before that, XXXX XXXX had partnered with Solar Mosaic Inc. Bank and they came together to start everything with me, and later to finance the project. They offered many good terms, such as, no up-front payment, low interest rate for the loan, no payment until the project was done and the system started producing electricity to replace the power from my power company, and there would be a XXXX warranty after the installation to cover the maintenance, repair of the solar system if anything would go wrong in the future. They also promised to repair my roof if any damage was done during the installation process, among other favorable terms. Those were common terms that could have been offered by any other solar installers then and today, because the government was, and still is, backing this kind of projects for the good of the society and the environment. So, I took their offer and signed agreements with both XXXX XXXX and Solar Mosaic Inc. Bank to let them work on the project ( please refer to Mosaic bill to me as evidence # XXXX XXXX 
In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX XXXX sent a group of technicians to my home address to do the first partial installation, then they left. I waited for a long time for them to come again to finish the work, but they never came again. Even worse, soon after that, I lost contact with them. After a while ( about in the beginning of XXXX ) I learned that the installer company had declared bankruptcy and no longer in business. I reported this to XXXX Bank. XXXX promised to find someone else to finish the job. Eventually, they found a XXXX business called XXXX, to finish the solar project. XXXX ( please refer to XXXX email correspondences to me as evidence # XXXX ) contacted me on the phone once and sent me a confirmation email each following month to confirm with me they were actively looking for someone in their network and in my area to do the job. But recently suddenly, Mosaic decided not to shoulder their responsibility and refer my case to a collection company ( please see the collection letter as evidence # XXXX ) for debt collection. This is not fair to me, and very wrong of Solar Mosaic to do this. 
I would like to make it clear here : {$27000.00} is the total cost for the whole project, including the material cost ( the solar panels ), the installation fee, the hood-up procedure to the power companys power grid, and the warranty service for the next 20 years after the installation. Since this is an unfinished and abandoned project, I would definitely not pay {$27000.00} for the collection. 
I started with a sweet dream of having solar power installed on my roof top ( that is what it was meant to be then, and still is today ), now it becomes a nightmare : I do not have a completed, working solar power system, instead, I am deep in debt to the bank. There supposed to be no immediate big cost to me. Now my electrical bill is the same, in addition to the huge debt I am in. My rights as a consumer have been seriously violated",No,

After two to three weeks I received two emails and two letters from Bank of America stating that the case is closed and that they found out that there was nothing suspicious, well in this case I strongly disagree with the Bank 's investigation. Because of the following points : 1.It is suspicious that I'll do four XXXX transfers from my account to the same person whom I do not know and when I asked the Bank about his phone number or who he is or his contact, the Bank gave me no answer so far. 
2.Usually when there is a XXXX transfer I receive a text message and an e-mail, checking my text message and my e-mail I did not find anything, and when I asked the Bank about why I didn't receive and e-mail or a text, they said that the e-mails and the text were deleted instantly. I strongly feel suspicious about this activity, transferring to the same person at the same time frame, and deleting all e-mails and texts, the Bank however should have sent all corresponding e-mails, that they've received or sent, instead of telling me that it was instantly deleted. This is highly evident that I've been a target to fraud, and the bank is not cooperating or launching a real investigation with all the their tools and means of investigation.

As I entered the bank I immediately went up to the first available window to proceed with the deposit and handed the check to the teller that asked me to insert my debit card into the reader and verify it with a PIN number, which I did right away and waited for the teller to process the check. Moments later the representative told me that the check went through fine and the funds were available for immediate use. I was quite surprised to hear that considering that Ive been banking for a long time and always had any larger amount check like this particular one to be placed on hold for further review and the funds to be available days if not weeks later. I then even made sure to ask the teller to double check if everything looks fine on the Banks end and if the money was safe for me to access. The response that I received assured me that everything was good and the check was legit as the teller mentioned that a cashiers check is basically like guaranteed money. Finally, I thanked the teller for the help and exited the bank. As soon as I left I decided to do a little more research on my own regarding cashiers checks and sure enough everything I found out supported the tellers response. After all, cashiers checks are treated as guaranteed funds and do not carry a risk of being bounced. Well, sadly this wasnt the result I received from banking with CHASE. 
The fact that there wasnt a single warning sign raised by CHASE Bank nor was there a hold placed on the check, not even for a single day ; any possible doubt that I had in my mind suddenly vanished. The funds were made available to me by CHASE Bank, the Bank that I have put all of my trust into as a loyal client. This convinced me to feel safe about doing further business with a person that turned out to be a fraud and baited me into being a victim of a SCAM. Trusting the CHASE Bank and their topnotch security to detect any fraudulent check that enters their system set me to be worry free and led me to proceed making two separate payments to the scammer, thinking that Im handling the payees money that was lended to me which I already had available in my personal checking account. The first payment of {$1000.00} to the phony vendor for the merchandise was made via XXXX on XXXX XXXX XXXX. & the second payment was made for {$400.00} on XXXX XXXX XXXX also via XXXX for a wrist watch that was discussed to be part of the advertisement. Shortly after the second payment the scammer stopped responding entirely and the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ) the chargeback for - {$1900.00} hit my account. Had the CHASE Bank representative informed me of any possible flaw or slightest chance of this cashiers check being returned, none of this would have taken place and caused me to be in this very difficult situation. Im almost certain that a giant Bank like JPMorgan CHASE has a system in place to recognize bad checks, however, on XX/XX/XXXX CHASE failed to protect my account from what they claimed to be an altered/fictitious check days after the initial transaction.",No,

If my name is not shown on the loan with XXXX, I will have difficultly applying the property tax and interest deductions to my tax filings. Worse, I may not be able to do that at all, which will create a significant tax burden for me.

This letter is a formal complaint that you report inaccurate and incomplete credit information. 
I am distressed that you have included the information below in my credit profile and have failed to maintain reasonable procedures in your operations to assure maximum possible accuracy in the credit reports you publish.

Congressional findings and statement of purpose ( a ) Accuracy and fairness of credit reporting Congress makes the following findings : ( 1 ) The banking system depends on fair and accurate credit reporting. Inaccurate credit reports directly impair the efficiency of the banking system, and unfair credit reporting methods undermine public confidence, which is essential to the continued functioning of the banking system.

( 2 ) An elaborate mechanism has been developed for investigating and evaluating the credit worthiness, credit standing, credit capacity, character, and general reputation of consumers.

( 3 ) Consumer reporting agencies have assumed a vital role in assembling and evaluating consumer credit and other information on consumers.

5957965,09/07/22,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"My mortgage company is Freedom Mortgage. 
On XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for covid 19 Mortgage forbearance due to reduce of income, process went through correctly, I was able to pause my mortgage for 6 months, On XX/XX/XXXX, I use my mortgage website to submit a request for an additional 6 Month of extension, and bring the expiration date to XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. 
I called the mortgage company on XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, and request information in way to exit forbearance, I was told by the representative that my Portal claim is already approved, and just want for the total due amount to reset back to normal, then I can start making normal month payment as before. 
After 2 months of patiently waited, I called the mortgage company and asked about it, then I was told that my account was delinquent with no action token after forbearance. After spoke with at lease 3 different people, no one can tell me what happened, and just told me that I need to submit supporting documents in order to get review, I refused and asked why do I need to provide those documents while I already have a partial claim, they did not have an answer for me, and told me that they will note it and do some research on it. 
I then finally ran out of patient as no one could tall me exactly what happened, I requested to speak to the supervisor directly. When I did, the supervisor informed me that my partial claim was cancelled due to the extension of my forbearance. Base on what the supervisor told me, and I have to come up with my conclusion, as the supervisor is trying not to tell me directly that they messed up. 
Here is my own conclusion, Someone ( not me ) exited my forbearance for me without my authorization, and make the expiration date on XXXX instead of the end of XXXX like it should be. I realized that on XXXX and called the mortgage company and asked why, I was informed at the time that the exit of forbearance was mistakenly submitted ( I did not request it ), but the rep told me that they can fix it for me, but instead of making the expiration date back to XX/XX/XXXX like it should be, they gave me another 6-month extension with the new expiration date as XXXX XXXX. 
I guess the partial claim was submitted for only from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, I never got to see the partial claim, when it got submitted, approved, or cancelled, thats why I can only guess. None of these transactions were show in my account portal or getting any mails regarding that. 

Now the mortgage company told me that there is no other option for me to take other than mortgage modification which will significantly increase my interest rate, and making these much harder for me to keep the property. I asked if I can still take the VA partial claim option since I was always staying on top of my account, but due to the fact that I was getting wrong information and time ran out while I was expecting that my account is approved for all the process and just need to be applied to my account. I asked them to submit the VA partial claim as they deadline is XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, Mortgage company refused and claim that the deadline has already past, I request them to confirm with the VA Mortgage department, they refused and insist than they were correct with the deadline and requirement. 

Moving forward, I can not change whats already happened, but I would like to get an option that I can afford and get back on track with my payment. While assuming all the information on https : //www.benefits.va.gov/HOMELOANS/partial_claim.asp are correct, my mortgage company just refuse to help me.

I completed the spend during the second month of card membership, and was on track to receive the bonus at the time of the statement close. 

During XXXX ( the third month of card membership ), Citi closed my card suddenly, without any warning or communicating their intention, and without giving a proper reason. The closure letter stated that they detected behavior that was not consistent with how other customers use their cards. I only assume that were referring to multiple payments made to my credit card during my card membership. I had a perfect reason for these payments and in my view there was nothing that should have led to the account closure ( at least not before talking with me ).

6029951,09/29/22,Checking or savings account,Managing an account,"This complaint is a culmination of a series of events that have transpired since XXXX of 2022. I had called citibank customer service on the last week of XX/XX/2022 to dispute charges that were made by XXXX and was given by the representative one dispute case number despite indicating and confirming with her that there were three transactions in total amounting to {$1900.00}. The breakdown of the transactions are as follows : {$1700.00}, {$170.00} and {$20.00}. Two letters from Citibank were generated and sent to me dated XXXX XXXX. The letter dated XX/XX/2022, informed me that my dispute has been opened for the {$1700.00} and the {$170.00} transactions. The 2nd letter, requested information regarding the disputed transaction for the {$170.00}. The letter stated that more information about the details of the inquiry was needed to obtain credit and for me to send an email or a signed letter explaining the dispute in detail and to include any related documentation. The letter also stated that IF I have a credit slip, credit memo or credit notification from the merchant, that I should include it. I sent a detailed lengthy letter to XXXX providing the details and reason for my dispute and attached several documentations to substantiate my reason to dispute the charges. Then another letter dated XX/XX/2022 that pertained to the {$1700.00} transaction arrived asking for more information to "" help with the investigation '' particularly a credit slip again. I called customer service and asked to be transferred to the dispute department to confirm that they have received my letter which i was told that they did and that a credit will be provided back to my account for both the {$1700.00} and the {$170.00} but they no mention of the {$20.00} which I was told after will also be processed. Upon the receipt of the letter, I immediately wrote to XXXX to tell them that all pertinent information and documentation has already been submitted in my XXXX email to them. On the XXXX of XXXX, another letter requesting for the same information was sent to me so i called again to confirm that my letter was received and that an investigation regarding the issue is being done. I was told that there was no update yet regarding the investigation to my dispute. Then a letter dated XX/XX/XXXX arrived telling me that "" since you can not provide proof the purchase was paid for using a payment method other than your account '', the {$170.00} provisional credit will be debited from my account. Confused by the letter, I, again, called customer service on the XXXX of XXXX and after being asked to explain the reason for my calling and explaining to the representative who claimed to be from the dispute department, my situation and getting a response that made me confused even more, I asked for a supervisor and was forwarded to a certain XXXX who then told me that the confusion resulted because I was not provided the proper Dispute claim numbers for each transaction namely the {$170.00} and the {$20.00} and that the documentation I sent was only applied to the {$1700.00} amount, which contradicts the first letter sent on XXXX documenting 2 amounts. He provided me with two more Dispute Claim numbers for the other amounts and instructed me to send another email appealing the result of the case and for it to be reopened and that he will also send a letter explaining the situation to whoever is handling the case. He also said that once the appeal is processed, the amount will be credited back to my account. I sent the letters with the corresponding reference numbers and included the original letter I sent together with the attachments since they all pertained to the same case I was disputing overall. After checking my account if the {$170.00} was credited back as i was told and not seeing it, I called to inquire again and this time I spoke to another supervisor called XXXX who informed me that the credit should have placed back in my account already but that there was no information regarding it was noted. He said that he will send an email to the people responsible for this and that he will call me back 24 to 48 hours from then between the hours of XXXX and XXXX EST to update me. Waited for his call but never heard from him again. Please note that at this point in time, I could not trust the words of any of the representatives and I also began to have doubts that my emails were being thoroughly read and the attachments reviewed properly as that would have provided them with all the necessary information to pursue the allegations of the fraudulent transaction that i was disputing. 
In the letter dated XX/XX/2022 that I received only yesterday, it said that "" without a valid credit slip '', the provisional credit of {$1700.00} will be debited from my account and that the investigation is now closed. I called customer service with the sole intention to ask what "" valid credit slip '' meant as it may be different from what I interpret it to be and after getting a response, i intended to be transferred to the dispute department. The first representative by the name of XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who answered was mumbling her words and after deciphering that she was asking me for the name on the account for verification, I gave her my name which is the same name I have provided before to access my account. She claims that my name is not valid and that I should call again when i have the proper information. I tried to argue with her that the information provided was correct but she insisted that it was wrong and that i should call later with the correct information over and over again. How can I get my name wrong?! As I was continuing to plead my case, I finally asked for a supervisor because there was no point talking to this person. The supervisor probably wasn't aware that I could hear him telling the representative that she only needed to confirm my first and last name. He finally came on and said his name was XXXX. I asked for his identification number ' as I have started to do whenever i interacted with the CITI representatives so that I can better distinguish them from the people there who might have the same name but he refused to provide me with it even after explaining to him why I had the right to ask for it and for him to provide me with that information. He then hangs up the phone on me! I call again and as my experience has taught me, I asked for a supervisor, aware that my situation might be too complicated for the average representative and was answered by XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who after hearing my complaint about the prior phone call and experience with the supervisor, filed a complaint for me and provided me with Complaint Number XXXX as its reference. XXXX and I were beginning to dissect the situation as to the validity of the bank debiting my account and closing the investigation citing that the credit slip which was being used as a reason could not be provided in the first place because that is specifically the reason why the dispute was made and that the merchant has refused to give back the money. This, to me, meant that XXXX actually read my explanation and went through the documents I sent. This is contrary to what another supervisor, named XXXX, has said after I have inquired about the meaning of a valid credit slip, he simply said that a credit slip is something that should state that the merchant is refunding the amount and without it there's nothing CITI can do regarding my dispute. I asked him what then is the purpose of disputing a charge that is considered fraudulent, sending all pertinent information, taking the time and effort to explain the situation in writing and the so called investigation you are conducting if all I had to do was get a credit slip? XXXX starts to mumble just like the very first representative i spoke with but ignores the question and presents an attitude as if he's tired of answering my questions and concerns. Unfortunately, after XXXX said that he needed to bring the subject to another colleague so that the proper corrections will be made, we were disconnected. I tried to call again to get transferred to him but the representative by the name of XXXX said that it couldn't be done. XXXX insisted that I tell him the situation and the reason for my call. I asked XXXX for his ID number and explained why since his name is especially very common but he declined to provide it and even laughed at me when I tried to persist. He even said while mocking me "" you can ask my supervisor his ID number and he MAY give it to you but I'm not going to give you mine! "". Frustrated by all this, I hung up the phone before speaking to another supervisor that I requested. I finally had a chance to speak to an XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) who was pleasant enough to ask to allow him to assist me since he was with the dispute department and offer that if I should wish to, he can also connect me with another supervisor. his tone was pleasant enough that I allowed myself to explain again for the nth time the situation and he confirmed what XXXX and i had discussed regarding the credit slip and suggested that I send another letter which included the same attachments I sent the very first time as that was the proof needed and to appeal the case and to have it reopened again. He said not to worry about the {$170.00} as that has already been reopened and to just concentrate on the {$1700.00} which will be debited. I had told him that I would send the letter of appeal and just include the original letter plus the attachments with it and he said that it would be sufficient and for me to call in 48 hours to confirm that the documents submitted has been uploaded. Sadly, after everything that has been said and done, I'll believe it when it actually happens. 
My question is, with what XXXX has said, did anyone actually read and take into consideration the initial letter and the attached documents as proof that the transactions were legitimate or did the dispute department just simply rely on the 'valid credit slip ' that I could not possibly provide to make their decision? Is the Dispute Department being negligent to actually do their job of providing service for CITIbank clients and 'investigating ' the dispute with due diligence? I was on the phone trying to get some answers and correct what I perceive to be a mistake regarding the handling of my dispute for about three and a half hours yesterday and only a couple of people, out of the more than a dozen representatives and supervisors, gave me the courtesy to actually listen and address my concerns. But even then, because of the numerous contradicting information given to me, I have lost trust in your customer service and dispute department which is truly unfortunate because despite having some exceptional people in these departments, it has been marred by those that give false, incorrect, and deceptive information and additionally, the ones that would rather escalate an already sensitive situation with aggressive, arrogant, argumentative and dismissive behavior. Aside from the branch, these customer service people who answers the phone are at the forefront of representing CITIbank and if this attitude goes on without repercussion or accountability then it reflects the same attitude that the company has towards its clients.",No,

The Dr. refused, told me I needed to pay a third payment of XXXX XXXX  to move forward and told me that a refund was not part of their policy. This was never disclosed and is fraud!

The aligners were NEVER given to me and I have my right to cancel a service that was never provided! I never received any XXXX treatment yet I am still being charged for this.

After two months of fighting this dispute and speaking to multiple agents, Chase told me there was nothing I could do to get my money back and left me to pay off nearly {$1600.00} USD. 

Chase has been a nightmare to deal with and after many calls and letters explaining the details of this fraud, they refuse to investigate further and wasted 2 months of my time.

On XXXX, XXXX of this year, I was defrauded out of {$25000.00} by an online scam. The scam unfolded over a series of events, but it was initiated by an unauthorized transfer from my Wells Fargo credit line. This transfer was done without my permission or knowledge and Wells Fargo never alerted me to its occurrence- despite the fact that the account from which the funds were transferred had not been active for nearly 56 years. The fraudulent and undetected transfer formed the entire basis of the scam ; since it was disguised as an outside deposit and provided the entire basis upon which the subsequent events occurred. 
Given the prevalence of internet related fraud and the corresponding authentication procedures that have arisen in response, I was astonished to learn that there were absolutely no precautionary measures taken on a credit line that was completely inactive. More importantly, however, is that when I went to my local branch to complain, I was told by Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX that an investigation by Wells Fargo Online Fraud Department determined that you or someone who had your authority authorized the withdrawal of {$25000.00} from my line of credit. Therefore, we have closed your claim. ( Document # XXXX ). 
It is bad enough that Wells Fargo failed to properly flag and notify me of this serious breach of my account by an outside party, but I now am being told that I somehow am ultimately responsible for this unauthorized activity- despite the fact that I was never even made aware of it in the first place. This is completely unacceptable and a violation of the Consumer Protection Act of 1968 and the Electronic Fund Transfer Act of XXXX which protect consumers from fraudulent and unauthorized withdrawal such as this one. 
I am an XXXX widower and retired veteran. I have been a faithful client for close to 58 years and expect the level of service and respect that I came to know Wells Fargo for offering. I demand that I be credited back for the {$25000.00} that were taken from my credit line immediately. I have already notified the California Attorney Generals Office, The Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. If this dispute is not met with my satisfaction, I intend to take the following steps : 1. I will hire a suitable lawyer and initiate a class action against Wells Fargo Bank.

2. I will send articles about my experience with Wells Fargo to all the local newspapers and will go on television with this story focusing on my treatment by Wells Fargo Bank after 56 years as a Wells Fargo client!

I first spoke with XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX and he informed me of their one-time close construction to perm product. I was told that I would just need to do one initial closing and that the loan product was a 20 % down, 12-month construction loan that would convert into a permanent loan automatically at the end of the construction period. I was told that there was a second loan that came a long term rate lock that ran concurrently with the construction loan and came with an approximately {$5000.00} extended lock fee that got reimbursed when I modified to the second portion of the loan, I was told they take this fee to ensure I do not try to work with any other lenders during the construction period and that I would lose that fee if I switched lenders. I asked XXXX what would happen if construction ran behind the 12-month schedule and was informed that the loan would be extended typically in 3-month increments but that there would be an extension fee associated with any extensions. There were items in the loan documents that outlined the costs of extension so I had no reason to question what XXXX had told me. This information provided by XXXX was further confirmed by the marketing material advertising this product on Gateway Mortgage Websites. XXXX and XXXX underwriting were providing our construction contract that outlined a 8-12 month build project and signed a contract with the builder outlining the same timeframe. 

We received our closing disclosure on XX/XX/XXXX which I sent back due to an error in the loan amount. It showed the wrong amount but the correct term of 30 years and a fixed rate of XXXX with the first 11 months being interest only and principal being applied to start in month XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received notification from XXXX XXXX that I had actually been approved to only put 10 % down so they were increasing my loan amount to approximately $ XXXX in order to reduce my cash to close. I agreed that this was ok and reviewed the closing disclosure which again stated 30 years and a fixed rate of 3.625 % with the first 11 months being interest only and principal being applied starting in month XXXX. 

XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX team that said the below Please find the attached final CD for your closing. The amount you need for closing is {$82000.00}, to wire the funds, you will need to contact the title company for them to give you the wiring instructions. Their information is below : Thanks, and let us know if you have any questions. Again this was the same disclosure I had signed that stated Closing Disclosure Stated I was receiving a 30-year loan with a Fixed 3.625 % interest rate that could not increase after closing. Since I was told this was a onetime close and I had a closing disclosure confirming had a 30-year fixed rate mortgage I had no reason for concern. 

Our loan closed the next day on XX/XX/XXXX At no point during the research of XXXX  materials for this product, discussion with loan officer, or during the closing process was I made aware that there was a risk of not get the locked interest rate, nor was their any mention of any risk of my payments nearly doubling. I was told that this was a XXXX time close loan that would modify at the end of the construction period. My construction to permanent change notification document states Rate for final modification is locked prior to closing the construction phase. Your end rate will be the same or lower, as your construction rate. When I received a closing disclosure that said I was receiving a 30 year loan with fixed rate that would not increase. I had no reason to question this because this is what I had been told from the beginning of the process. 

On their website XXXX describes this loan as Perfect for homebuyers with good credit, stable job and income history, and are seeking to build their dream home with the flexibility of conventional financing combined with the cost savings and convenience of one loan closing. 

In XXXX brochure they describe the modification process as below : MODIFICATION PROCESS : Although your builder has completed the project and has received the final draw, the modification process must be completed before you move into your new home. 
XXXX. Rate : You must lock your permanent interest rate. If you locked during construction, this step is complete. If you have not locked, please contact your Loan Originator to discuss your lock. Afterwards, your Loan Originator will inform our modification desk of your loans particulars. 
XXXX. Updating Credit Information : Depending on your XXXX and credit score, XXXX may require updated income and credit documentation to ensure the best rate possible. 
XXXX. Document Signing : Once your rate is locked, we will contact you to arrange a time for you to sign the modification documents. 
XXXX. Funds Due at Signing : Expenses due at modification may include the following : Construction interest due up to time of signing. Prepaid interest due on the permanent loan. Escrow setup ( property taxes, insurance, and mortgage insurance ). Any shortages in the inspection fees. Any unforeseen costs not paid from the initial closing. 




On approximately XX/XX/XXXX. I was notified by the builder of my project that they were running approximately one month behind the estimated 12-month timeline due to issues with XXXX, a large fire in the area combined with supply chain issues on a couple of the materials needed for the home. My builder reached out to the loan administrator at Gateway Mortgage with the same information and was told on XX/XX/XXXX they are being fairly lenient because of Covid with extensions. She said when the loan is within about 30 days of expiring, the loan officer will send a letter asking if you need an extension. 

After receiving this information I reached out to my loan officer XXXX XXXX along with the other assistants involved in my initial loan transaction to notify them with as much notice as possible of the potential delay and to prepare for anything that would be needed for an extension. I did not receive any response from XXXX and still have not received any word from him as of today XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XXXX I reached out to XXXX XXXX who sends my monthly statements because I still had not had any response from anyone at XXXX regarding an extension. At this point, I was provided with the information that XXXX XXXX was no longer with the company and that my new loan officer was XXXX XXXX. I immediately called the number that she provided and the phone was answered by an assistant of XXXX XXXX. At this point I was first informed that the permanent loan would only be extended up to 30 days. I asked him what happened if the rate expired and I was no longer able to qualify for the permanent loan. His response was that his advice is to make as much income as possible and wait to see what happens. I informed him that with only a couple of months left to convert the loan it was unlikely that I would be able to add enough income to offset an approximately {$18000.00} annual increase in payments based on current rates and approximately {$540000.00} over the life of the loan. I again asked him what options I had if I dont qualify for the new loan payments and was told that he would call me back. 

On the afternoon of XX/XX/XXXX I still did not have a response from XXXX XXXX 's assistant so I sent an email requesting a call from XXXX to review my concerns and to prepare for what we needed to do to have a successful modification from the construction to perm loan. I received a call back from XXXX the same day but we were not able to connect until the next morning XX/XX/XXXX. 

On XXXX I made contact with XXXX XXXX XXXX At this time I was first informed that my rate lock had already expired a few days earlier on XX/XX/XXXX. He expressed frustration with XXXX XXXX for doing this to dozens of borrowers where he locked the rate long before the loan actually closed causing the permanent loan to expire months before our construction loan without explaining that impact to the borrowers. This decision left us with a rate lock that expired before our estimated completion date of the build. According to XXXX this now requires us to get a new loan at current rates that we can not afford. At todays rates the new payment is approximately {$1600.00} per month higher or over 60 % higher than what we were quoted and under the impression was locked and fixed since we had closed our loan months before. All of XXXX ' promotional materials for this loan product stating that once you "" lock the rate this step was complete '' are completely false. I asked XXXX why I was not contacted prior to our rate lock expiring as we were told would happen 30 days prior by multiple people at XXXX and he stated that he is very busy with hundreds of files. I also asked XXXX if he or XXXX had ever informed me that he was my new loan officer to which he had no response. Had I been informed that I had a new loan officer I would not have lost several weeks trying to get a response from XXXX and would have had the opportunity to extend my lock the initial 30 days per XXXX policy. I again asked what options I have if I can not afford the new payment since I am now a couple of months away from having a {$620000.00} loan that needs to be paid off and XXXX is not willing to honor the rate for the modification I was given at closing on the XXXX close mortgage. I even restated that I was willing to pay the lock extension fees for the extensions which I was originally told I would incur. XXXX response was that he can not speak for the board at XXXX but that they would probably not want to foreclose. I again asked XXXX if there were any options to work together for a solution that was not foreclosure since I am willing and able to pay the amount originally locked and would have never taken the loan if I had known there was no option to extend due to COVID delays and he stated that there were not any other solutions and that it was not his fault my builder was running behind. He also stated that there are hundreds of people at XXXX in the same position as me. I asked him if that isnt there a problem with their practices if they have hundreds of people with no ability to repay the loans that XXXX generated. To Which he had no response. He lastly stated that if I have a problem with Gateways policies I can give the owner of XXXX, XXXX XXXX a call. XXXX told me that he was the head of XXXX for TN and there was no branch manager above himself that I could speak with. 


In my opinion, there are many unfair and predatory practices involved in XXXX One Time Close Product that by XXXX XXXX 's own admission are harming hundreds of their consumers. 

XXXX. Admittedly they have a loan officer that was explaining the XXXX rate lock as running concurrently with the construction loan which it did not. They have documents in the loan package stating the rate for the modification will be the same or lower than the initial rate. Since other banks offer true onetime close loans the loan officer has an incentive to mislead the borrower into thinking that this is the same or very similar product. They also had my build contract showing a 12-month build, which was reviewed by the loan officer and I assume the underwriter and not one mention was made that I would not have the option to extend the rate to the projected length of the build. Essentially negating any benefit I would have gotten from choosing this product. 
XXXX. They blatantly disregarded any fiduciary duty or duty of care and fair dealings owed to me as a client of a closed loan with them. They avoided contact prior to the expiration of my rate lock. I attempted to make contact with my loan officer prior to the lock expiration and got no response. Not only that the new loan officer responsible for my file did not attempt to make me aware that he was my new contact. He also stated that he was the manager and was aware that this was a problem happening with many of XXXX XXXX 's files and still no communications. This shows an attempt at deception to allow the lock to expire so that they would not have to honor their commitment or their policy. 
XXXX. Their advertising materials blatantly mislead the borrower regarding the true facts and risks of this product. Nowhere does it state that it is possible for rates and payments to double at the end of 12 months or in my case at the end of 10 months. 
XXXX. In combination with misleading advertising and statements to send a closing disclosure that states a 30-year conventional fixed-rate loan in which the interest rate can not increase after closing and then 10 months after the closing inform me that that was not correct and that they can double that rate is false and misleading. 
XXXXThey have the borrowers in a very tough spot after closing the initial loan because XXXX. The builder has to be approved which takes time so finding an alternative that meets the criteria during the allotted time frame is not really a option if there are any issues with the builder. 
XXXXThey also have the borrowers in a pinch after closing because even though they supposedly closed both loans at the closing table if there are any delays in the timeline they are able to cancel and make more by denying the borrowers an extension and forcing them to take out a new loan at a higher rate causing a drastic increase in payment that they may not be able to afford. If the borrower does not qualify for the new rate then they have no ability to repay the construction portion of the loan making their one-time close loan not really a one-time close loan. 
XXXX. Multiple people within this institution use the fact that there are two different loans with two different terms to selectively and falsely answer questions from the consumer. For example, I asked multiple people, multiple times regarding extending my loan and was told that before during, and after closing my loan I would be contacted 30-60 days prior and given an option to extend at a cost. When it came down to it they are now telling me that is true but only on the construction portion of the loan. If a consumer asks a question about a one-time close and a lender chooses to only answer the question about one-half of that loan and not make mention that it does not apply to the other portion, that is dishonesty and deception. This is also a problem within the loan documents. Since there are essentially two different loans that supposedly close at the same time modify later there are a lot of documents involved in the closing. They blur the lines between those two loans to create confusion for the borrowers. There is a page in my note that outlines the cost and process of extension that matches what XXXX originally told me. When I point to that after the fact they again state well that it was only for the construction loan and now tell me that they do not need to honor that for the loan modification. 

I feel that XXXX Mortgage employed a multitude of deceptive and unfair tactics in generating this loan. When making the branch XXXX aware of the problem I was not offered a single solution other than wait and hope they choose not to foreclose. I feel that both my original and current loan officers were clearly not working in my best interest and breached the fiduciary responsibility that they had to me.",No,

We believe has violated the law under XXXX. Detailed below is the months long process of attempting to correct our escrow account, have funds owed to us refunded by the institution, and have our escrow payments revaluated to the appropriate amount required to make all payments ( property tax and insurance ). 
UWM practices are unfair to the public. As you can see, it has taken 13 calls to UWM to have our escrow account reevaluated, in the meantime, we are required to pay ~ {$600.00} essentially overfunding our escrow account. We still are required to write a letter to have funds owed to us returned, with no guarantee the funds will be returned to us, not documentation or letter provided to us as to the result of their investigation.

The definition of Unfair per the CFPB : A representation, omission, act, or practice is deceptive when ( 1 ) The representation, omission, act, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer ; ( 2 ) The consumers interpretation of the representation, omission, act, or practice is reasonable under the circumstances; and ( 3 ) The misleading representation, omission, act, or practice is material. 
An unsubstituted increase of {$600.00} a month in escrow funds is a significant impact to us the consumer. That amount is not insignificant and it carries a financial burden. In the information detailed below, it is clear the UWM staff mislead us, did not provide promised follow-up, failed to provide details as to the review of our account.

Although their UWM staff appear to be untrained, providing misinformation, and making promises they company cant keep, truly it seems as though the customer service is set up to deceive their customers. As outlined in the CFPBs definition of deceptive acts or practices : A representation, omission, act, or practice is deceptive when ( 1 ) The representation, omission, act, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer ; ( 2 ) The consumers interpretation of the representation, omission, act, or practice is reasonable under the circumstances; and ( 3 ) The misleading representation, omission, act, or practice is material.

On the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX in my home in the XXXX, I received their letters dated XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX. In the letter dated XX/XX/XXXX, my dispute case was denied stating that all of the 10 unauthorized ATM withdrawals of a total {$3800.00} appear to be consistent with your normal banking activities, though they are not. 

I am therefore exercising my right to appeal this denial of the ATM withdrawals in the amount of {$3800.00} as well as to appeal the dispute of the unauthorized charges amounting to {$13000.00}. I have yet to receive any resolution on my dispute on the unauthorized charges. Given the time it has taken, I will interpret this to mean that my dispute on this issue on the fraudulent charges has also been denied and thus I likewise appeal the denial of said charges. 

On the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX, I called the Citi XXXX Department at XXXX and advised them that I wanted to appeal the denial of my dispute. I spoke to XXXX and XXXX of the dispute department and both advised me to file my dispute via facsimile. 

I maintain my position that my debit card was hacked by unauthorized persons who made charges without my consent. To prove that I had no hand in these charges, I again reiterate that I never use my debit card in the XXXX as I have local cards which I use in the XXXX from XXXX. My entire transaction history from the XXXX of XXXX in which I first obtained my card ending in XXXX will attest to this. More importantly, once I learned that Citibank was of the position that it was denying my dispute, I reported the incident to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX Police ( PNP ) on the XXXX of XXXX, XXXX. 

Attached are my Complaint-Affidavit of dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX filed with the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX appearance attesting that I appeared at the XXXX to XXXX my complaint dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Team Certification on the police report dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, the PNP Anti-Cybercrime Team Certification on the supplemental report dated XXXX XX/XX/XXXX.

The photo taken from the XXXX footage clearly shows that the person who made the transaction using the fake debit card and drivers license was not me. 

Supplemental report in relation to investigation being conducted by this Group relative to complaint filed by dated XX/XX/XXXX for violation of R.A. 8484 otherwise known as the Access Devices Regulation Act of XXXX as Amended by R.A. 1149 and pursuant to Sec. 6 of R.A. 10175 dated XX/XX/XXXX with XXXX XXXX no.

Copy of documents pertinent to the said transaction showed that a Citibank Credit Card under the name of account holder with expiry dated of XX/XX/XXXX was used, and as proof of identity, said individual presented a Drivers License under the name of the account holder with false license number XXXX. Relative thereto, herein complainant presented his drivers license with a different license number to compare with the one presented for the transaction and found that said IDs were dissimilar. Likewise, herein complainant further averred that the signature on the invoice was not his signature. In corroboration, XXXX footage was viewed and showed that the individual who made the said transaction was not one and the same as complainant. 

I have also hired a XXXX XXXX lawyer XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, who has reported the incident to Citibank in the United States and who has been coordinating with XXXX XXXX XXXX the Citibank Branch XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX where I opened my account. He has not responded to inquiries since the XXXX of XXXX. 

This appeal has merit because it is clearly not me who made these charges as shown in the photo taken from the XXXX and in attached photos comparing the real debit card ending in XXXX and the fake debit card ending in XXXX. A comparison of the fake drivers license with my drivers license reveals the clear and distinct differences in height, weight, license number, agency code, blood type, DT codes and even the signature used in the fake license compared with those found in my actual license attest to the merit of this appeal. 

I simply do not know anymore what else Citibank will require for me to prove these charges are unauthorized. I did not make these transactions. The evidence is clear and convincing.

5970942,09/11/22,Credit card or prepaid card,Trouble using your card,"I received a new Barclays XXXX XXXX Credit Card in XX/XX/2022. I immediately activated it using the number in the sticker. When i tried using it, it didn't work. So, i called customer service, the XXXX Barclays representative says, it is activated and i may use it the same day. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, i opened a XXXX account ( which is now under Barclays, too! ) I haven't received the XXXX  cc that i knew must be paid in XX/XX/XXXX, so i called the customer service listed on the back of XXXX XXXX. It says there my balance which is {$300.00} which i paid using the my XXXX  XXXX XXXX to the XXXX credit card # on XX/XX/XXXX. It appeared as paid per Bank XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

When i called XXXX XXXX customer service phone #, it says i still owe {$300.00} + the interest. I spoke with a representative & mentioned that i already paid, it had been deducted to my XXXX  XXXX XXXX account. When i mentioned my XXXX XXXX account #, they said it is not in the system and for me to call XXXX. I called XXXX and they said call Barclays. I have been dealing with this since XXXX. I even have to file off from work since customer service always takes XXXX or more hours to speak with. I also have records of me calling customer service rep every now and then. 

I have requested for my late fee to be waived and said please send my XXXX card asap so i may pay it ( for the 2nd time ) They said they'll just send me the extra money that i paid and wait for my check. Once i received my XXXX card, i paid using XXXX  XXXX XXXX via electronic payment. After a few days, i received a XXXX check, but the whole amount that i paid for XXXX- which means i paid and they sent it all back to me! Which means, i am not paid yet & another late fee again. I called again customer service, they said, just deposit the check to your bank then pay it online using Barclays app, which i did. 

I deposited the check, as soon as it cleared, it deducted right away to be paid to XXXX  since the check says PAID to XXXX  with its account #. 

All is all i paid XXXX. 1st via XXXX account # which is floating right now in the air. 2nd, i paid when as soon as i received my XXXX card - but the check was sent back to me. 3rd, when i deposited the XXXX check, it automatically paid XXXX since it's addressed to them for payment. 4th, when i paid using their app. 

So, now my problems are : 1. When i paid initially to XXXX XXXX, where does the money from XXXX  XXXX XXXX being paid if that XXXX XXXX account doesn't exist? 

2. Why is it that no one from Barclays and XXXX know what to do with my account? My XXXX XXXX is rising up due to this and it is not fair that i need to file for days off just to deal with them. 

3. My credit score dropped XXXX points due to XXXX XXXX account being closed and late payments ( XXXX  ) which i paid many times. How will it get fixed?

In fact, when we had a follow up call with them, they told us they had missed the mark and had fired staff as a result of poor performance during the event. They have also been banned from ever going back to the venue forever given their poor performance. 

The caterer agreed that money should be refunded but they deferred to Bank of America to figure out the reversal on the money that should be refunded. Unfortunately Bank of America refuses to refund anything despite both parties agreeing that money should be refunded. 

There were multiple problems on both days of the event.

A client wanted to use a credit card to pay some fees and to place money in an XXXX account that was attached to Square. I added another account to my Square account because some of the funds did not need to be in the XXXX account. I received confirmation that the new account was verified by Square. ( XXXX ) On XXXX XX/XX/XXXX, I processed a transaction for {$9500.00} using the credit card information provided by the client for that purpose. The {$9500.00} payment was received by Square ( XXXX XXXX ). The following day, XXXX withdrew its fee of {$330.00} from the funds ( XXXX. XXXX ). I responded to an unrequested series of emails from Square offering to expedite the transfer of the remaining funds if I would open a checking account and order a debit card from XXXX XXXX XXXX ( "" XXXX '' ) immediately. I started the process but was met with message indicating that the immediate transfer of {$2000.00} could not be processed. I contacted Square on XXXX XXXX and got conflicting stories. One story was that the 2-Step Verification Process was not enabled and the another story was about "" unusual activity. '' I looked at my end and found not "" unusual activity '' except that I learned that Square had disconnected the XXXX account and only the new account was active. Note : I never asked for the new account to replace the XXXX account ; only to add another bank account to more easily track client funds. After several attempts that were unsuccessful, I asked to clarification. I received an email from XXXX XXXX from Square Account Services inquiring about the 2-Step Verification and asking me to enable it. ( XXXX. XXXX ) This email was a response to my request for information about the delay in transferring funds. I called Square and explained that the 2-Step Verification was enabled in XXXX- when I first became a Square customer. Nothing had changed and the Dashboard that was part of my account and a Square portal clearly indicated in green that the 2-Step Verification was enabled. I became suspicious. 

Many telephone calls, chat messages, and several emails then followed. XXXX reached out on XXXX XXXX via email ( XXXX. XXXX ) but offered nothing in the way of issue identification or resolution ; only that I could respond to the email. On XXXX XXXX, I responded to XXXX in an email ( XXXX ) that detailed the numerous inconsistencies from XXXX person to the next at Square and the run around and the reasons why I sensed that there was something amiss especially because the XXXX Verification was always enabled but NEVER used and Square still had XXXX the money minus their fee. I heard nothing back from XXXX despite the fact that she wrote that she would "" address [ my concerns ] promptly '' in XXXX. XXXX. 

On XXXX XXXX, having heard nothing from Square, I contacted them. Once again, I spoke with Customer Support ( see, XXXX. XXXX ) and once again received inconsistent statements and asked for someone with supervisorial/managerial authority. XXXX responded on XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, I sent an email ( XXXX. XXXX ) to XXXX to inform him/her that reliance on the fact that a prior email should not be relied upon because I had still not heard back from XXXX. Then, I wrote again to XXXX ( XXXX. XXXX ) indicating a high level of frustration at the lack of customer support from Square 's "" Customer Support '' department. 

I attempted to reach the legal department of Block Inc and Square Inc in XXXX XXXX, California where I know that some of the attorneys are working on XXXX XXXX. There is no reasonable method of determining a telephone number or email address for their general counsel ( XXXX XXXX ) or any of the scores of attorneys that are associated with or employed by Block Inc and Square Inc . Even the telephone number listed on 10Q 's and other SEC filings are pointed to the computerized telephone answering tree through which there is little that can be accomplished except to speak with other customer support people who did nothing to address the issues. ( See, transcript Ex. 17 ). 

I became compelled to do something immediately because client funds are involved. I simply could not sit back and wait while client funds were being converted and stolen by Block Inc and Square Inc . I began to formulate a lawsuit that, among other things, would allow me to petition the Court for a prejudgment writ to seize the money from Block/Square and to seek attorney fees. I have provided the same 6 pages of the draft to Square as appear in Ex. 16 with no response whatsoever. I provided the first copy on XXXX XXXX and incredulously, an internet company like Block/Square apparently does not provide technology to its so-called Customer Support team to open a regular pdf formatted document. ( See, Ex. 17, pg 5 of 6 wherein XXXX states : "" I do apologize I am not able to open that document. '' ) In short, Block/Sqaure clearly blocks all reasonable attempts to get customer issues resolved in an amicable and expeditious manner. Nothing gets accomplished and no relevant and reliable information is provided. In some instances, they claim that the issue will take 1-2 days while on the same date with regard to the same issue, the representation is 3-5 days. Today, under any analysis of their shifting process, it had been longer than even their convoluted and inaccurate customer service team has allowed. 

I can not play this game with Block/Square any longer. I must take action because client funds are involved. I am XXXX and no longer in the same good health as I was when I was younger. Block/Square is playing games and doing whatever is necessary to avoid resolving the issue. I would like the CFPB to investigate the customer support policies and procedures in use at Block/Square .

During my call on XX/XX/XXXX, I was told by the representative that my account balance will be updated to reflect the total of the specific loan payments ( {$20000.00} ) in a few business days and the refund to my account will take up to 150 business days. As of XX/XX/XXXX, my account balance has not been updated like I was told. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I called my loan service Edfinancial Services again to get more information about updating my account balance to {$20000.00} and to check on my refund status. I was then told conflicting information by a second representative that the refund has to be processed first before the account balance is updated. They could not give me any accurate information on the timeline of when the refund would be processed. 

The first representative from XX/XX/XXXX confirmed that my account balance would update to {$20000.00} in a few business days, which is what I will need to be reflected to be eligible to apply for forgiveness. Again, my current account balance is not updated like I was told.

5999691,09/20/22,Debt collection,Communication tactics,"I just got off the phone with a collection agent that had advised that the ONLY WAY to get the calls to stop is to setup a future dated debit card payment. 

That is not what I was previously advised and Im pretty sure prior to this occasion I filed a XXXX complaint that has gone unanswered due to a poor customer service issue with XXXX who advised me that there is a grace period where I will not get charged interested and no late charge until after 10 days after my due date. 

I simply attempted to advised her that in a simple interest contract there is NO GRACE PERIOD. Simple interest uses a per diem, which in XXXX means per day. Therefore, there is no grace period of when interest will be charged. There is a window until a late charge is applied. 

This company truly has poor training skills in their agents and even worse the supervisor, XXXX I spoke with seemed very unwilling to help and did not seem to care what I had to say. Expressed no empathy and gave me an apology just so I would get off the phone. 

I dont think this company truly cares about their customers and I am sure as soon as they read it will roll their eyes and think that I do not know what I am talking about, but little do they know I have worked 5 years in the Finance industry with Simple Interest contracts. 

I want a GENUINE apology and a contact number for their Director who oversees their Training, Compliance and Quality Assurance department to get an understanding of why they are not training proper customer service and collection tactics and if their agents even take a compliance assessment to go over who the CFPB is, UDDAP, etc.",No,
5973766,09/12/22,Mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,"My Name is XXXX XXXX, I am filling a compliant against our Previous loan provider XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and our current loan provider ( LoanCare ). Our mortgage loan was sold to XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX of XXXX while we were on the care act mortgage relief. Our relief ended and XXXX XXXX XXXX sent out documents for a XXXX XXXX. We followed the steps, filled out the documents and got it notarized and mailed it back before the deadline. We received a letter and from XXXX XXXX XXXX stating our loan modification has been completed along with copies of new loan amount and when payments would begin. 

XX/XX/XXXX is when we got the new documents with payment and new loan terms. We called in to make our first payment per promissory note and found out that our loan has been sold back to Loan Care. 

Took about a day calling back and forth between the mortgage companies because neither one of them said we was with them each time we called they would inform us our loans were with each other. Finally Loan Care, provide us with a new account number and to give that number when we called. 

Loan Care informed us that it would take 60 days for our account to update and reflect new information form XXXX XXXX XXXX and not worry as we are protected under law for when your account gets sold. 

60 days came and went, however my husband ( XXXX XXXX ) and myself had been calling each month on the top of each new month for updates with our account. 

In XXXX we received a new Loan Modification Packet from Loan Care. We were immediately confused as we just went through a loan modification and got approval documents. 

We then called into loan care and they said they have no records form XXXX XXXX of a loan modification and to fax them our proof. Well on XX/XX/XXXX I spent {$45.00} dollars faxing in copies requested. They said it would take 24 hours to show up in their system! Well 24 hours went by and they said they never got the fax, even though we had conformation that. the fax was received!. 

We then sent documents via email, and they finally had the copies. Loan Care then told us give them a few days to go over the information. its now the end of XXXX and new month is approaching we have not heard back form Loan care, I call in and ask for leadership and got transferred to a Supervisor by the name of XXXX ( employee number XXXX  ) he then said he would escalate the matter to loss mitigation management and they would give us a call in 24 hrs. 

The new month is here ( XXXX ) and we hear nothing back so we call in again. This time we get a new supervisor by the name of XXXX XXXX employee number XXXX ) as a supervisor in Loss mitigation department. XXXX, she confirms the New loan modification documents has been received and went through each document and confirmed with me over the phone the payment amount and new terms of the loan modification. She said they are still under reviewe with the department, and asked if we had our payments. We said yes, she then tells us to make our back payment per the new loan modification terms. XXXX tells us that the reason the ticket is still sitting open is because we have not followed the promissory note on making payments and that if we sent the payment then they can see that we followed the new terms and our account will then get update to reflect. We sent in the full payment for {$8600.00} via bank transfer wire. They payment was for the months of XXXX, XXXX, XXXX and XXXX. 

XXXX as said they she would open a ticket to fix the bad reporting to the credit bureau to reflect current. XXXX is the only one that has helped us and it seem very promising, as we got a letter in the mail form Loan Care that they are working on fixing the error of reporting negative when were protected under the Care Act and two we were current during that so it should report as such. 

XXXX said give it a couple of weeks or so for underwriting to update the account to reflect the new terms and to continue to make our payments on time each month until it updates in the system. We are current on our payments. 

XXXX forward to XXXX, and the account is to reflecting negative and nothing has changed on our account. It still showing we are 40 payments be-hide with the old loan terms. 

We are beyond frustrated at this point with Loan Care and how long it's taking them to honor the new loan modification. This has been going on for months!

I immediately contacted Citibank to open a dispute into this transaction, and concurrently notified XXXX XXXX XXXX about this charge. 

Several weeks after filing my dispute, I proactively contacted Citibank to inquire whether I could provide any supplemental information as I had not received any follow up from Citibank. I was provided an email to submit supplemental information along with the Case # and Transaction # provided by the representative, and on XX/XX/2022 I emailed Citibank to provide my statement along with email correspondence with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX statements from XXXX, and confirmation of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX 

In early XXXX I finally received an update dated XX/XX/2022 from Citibank about the dispute requesting proof of cancellation and any additional supportive information -- all of which was already provided on XX/XX/2022. The update essentially summarized that XXXX XXXX XXXX responded with a standard terms of agreement copy that subscribers are responsible for all charges. I contacted Citibank to question why the material I submitted was not considered, and she was able to retrieve the XX/XX/2022 email and upload contents to my file. I also provided additional material via email on XX/XX/2022 as I had already reached a resolution directly with XXXX XXXX XXXX, where they agreed that the charges were erroneous and removed. I attached a letter from the FCC confirming that the matter was escalated to the Office of the President at XXXX XXXX XXXX and resolved, and there should be no further need to dispute this charge as my balance was cleared. 

I thought that this would be the end of the dispute, but on XX/XX/2022 I received another update from Citibank stating that they did not receive a response to their request for supplemental information. This is patently false, and I contacted Citibank yet again to have them look into the materials I submitted on both XX/XX/2022 and XX/XX/2022. I spoke with an agent named XXXX from the disputes department who attempted to contact an investigator but their response was that this dispute was considered closed and that I would need to file an appeal.

I took the time to provide detailed feedback on your resolution. However, I wish to once again inform you and Experian of these matters in hopes that they are actually taken seriously this time around. I detailed a list of violations, which were never addressed. Those violations are as follows. Violation 1 : 15 U.S. Code 1681i : I wrote to Experian more than once, via certified mail, and have XXXX proof that Experian actually conducted any investigations into my matter. They never responded to my disputes or provided me with the results of any alleged investigations.

I do not feel as if my right to privacy is being respected by any means and I will tell you why below. Nor do I feel like I am being treated fairly!

NONE of the financial institutions provided me with a clear and conspicuous disclosure form to provide me with the choice to opt out of reporting. Financial institutions may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose to a nonaffiliated third party ANY nonpublic personal information, unless such financial institution provides or has provided to the consumer a notice. I, the consumer was never given an explanation of how I can exercise that nondisclosure option. I never provided consent or direction to any companies listed to share my information.
